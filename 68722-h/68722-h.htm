<h2 class="nobreak">AUTHOR’S FOREWORD</h2>

</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/deco1.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Some</span> years ago, I received from an important Southern
town, a letter from a Ladies’ Temperance Committee, to
this effect:—“Sir, We, the undersigned, are a committee of
Ladies, who, for many years, have purchased your “Stories for
the People” in very large numbers, for free distribution and
loan; always assuming that you were to be thoroughly relied
upon as an upholder of strict Total-abstinence principles. But
your latest story has sadly undeceived us, as regards your usefulness
as a worker in the great cause we are pledged to uphold
and further. On <i>pp</i> —— of your last story, you make your hero,
returning from a day’s run with the hounds, come upon a woman
lying in a lonely place, who has been injured in a trap accident.
You say, speaking of your hero’s prompt help to the woman, that
“taking his hunting flask from his pocket, he forced a few drops
of the brandy between the woman’s lips, etc.” Now, sir, we
contend that had you had the cause of Total-abstinence fully
at heart, you would have made that huntsman’s flask to have
contained <i>water</i>.”</p>

<p>So much for the letter. The moral of it lies on the surface.
There are some persons who seem unable to see anything from
the side of <i>real, actual</i> life—that Ladies’ committee could not—whose
vision is narrowed down to the tiny slit of their own
cramped, cabined life and thought, they have no true <i>out</i>look
upon life, as a whole.</p>

<p>I preface this foreword with the above incident, because
I am perfectly certain that the standpoint from which I have
written this book will be utterly, absolutely misunderstood by
many earnest, loving-hearted people, whose eyes, with my own,
have caught the <i>up</i>ward gaze “from whence we look for the
return of the Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>I would at once acknowledge that the inceptive idea of writing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
such a book as this was born within me from reading “Long
Odds,” that wondrous little half-penny booklet written by the
late General Robertson, I believe, a booklet that has been so
marvellously “owned and blessed.”</p>

<p>For five or six years the idea for this present volume has
been simmering and seething in my mind. The first and only
real problem I had to face in the matter was that of the <i>principle</i>
involved in using the fictional form to clothe so sacred a subject
(for, to me, the near Return of our Lord is the <i>most</i> sacred
of all subjects.) But the problem of the <i>principle</i> was speedily
settled, as I remembered how wondrously God had owned and
blessed “Long Odds,” in which the fictional is the vehicle of
the teaching.</p>

<p>Then, too, there are, I know, myriads of people into whose
hands “Long Odds,” could never, by any chance, fall—for there
are multitudes who will not so much as glance at, or touch a
tract, while a volume will easily win its way among all classes.
There is an enormous percentage of attendants at our churches
and chapels, and many otherwise very earnest Christian workers,
to whom the whole subject of the Lord’s Second Coming is an
absolutely unknown realm of Truth—and these I would fain
reach and arouse with the message of this book.</p>

<p>To those Christians who are looking for the Return of the
Lord, to whom the subject is the most tenderly sacred of all
subjects, who will at first sight condemn the use of the fictional
element, the dramatic colour in this book—and many good
people will, I am assured—I would say, first, that the book is
not written for them, and second, that, our Lord Himself, speaking
of His own Return, used two very remarkable illustrations
from life’s strangest dramas. First, “<i>As it was in the days of
Noah, even so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man.
They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage,
until <span class="smcap">the day</span></i>, etc.” Now, think what a myriad <i>dramas</i> were
being enacted when the flood came. And had the disciples asked
their Lord, privately, after His utterance, to explain more fully
what He meant, what thrilling stories He <i>could</i>, He <i>doubtless
<span class="smcap">would</span> have sketched</i>. If any Christian cavils at the dramatic in
this book, I would refer him or her to Christ’s own pointing in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
the picture of Noah’s time, then bid them fill out, by help of the
feeblest, simplest imagination, the picture of the myriad dramas
that were being enacted when that flood came, of old time. Then,
if the objector is honest, and is <i>capable</i> of the least imagination,
he will say “I see! and, now that I see this fact, my wonder is
<i>not</i> that there is a certain dramatic freedom in this book, but
that the writer has kept so powerful a restraint upon his pen.”</p>

<p>Again, Christ said:—“<i>As it was in the days of <span class="smcap">Lot</span></i>,” etc. Now
think over <i>this</i> saying of our Lord’s, and remembering what is
actually recorded in Genesis, of the <i>vice</i> and <i>crime</i> of Sodom,
(and how, alas! even when saved from the doomed city, Lot
and his daughters brought away much of the vicious, criminal
essence of the place with them,) think how the Return of our
Lord, presently, will mean the snatching away of many of His
own out of scenes infinitely more awful than anything I have
used herein, or ever hinted at. A book written on the subject
here chosen, and written in the vein our Lord Himself suggests
in the two passages referred to above, could not have been
written in any other way—to be true to life, and to the subject.</p>

<p>Should any reader object to the expository lectures of Major
H——, as the chief vehicle for the doctrinal teaching, I would
say that personal experience has proved the style to be infinitely
more acceptable to readers than that of the dialogue mode.</p>

<p>I have purposely placed special emphasis on the Jewish side
of the subject, since the Jewish question is infinitely more closely
enwrapped with the fact of our Lord’s near return, than many
speakers and writers give prominence to.</p>

<h1>“IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE”</h1>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50px;">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">TAKEN AT THE FLOOD.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">The</span> man walked aimlessly amid the thronging press.
He was moody and stern. His eyes showed his
disappointment and perplexity. At times, about his
mouth there lurked an almost savage expression. As a
rule he stood and walked erect. Only the day before
this incident one of a knot of flower-girls in Drury Lane
had drawn the attention of her companions to him as
he strode briskly along the pavement, and in a rollicking
spirit had sung, as he passed her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Stiff, starch, straight as a larch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Every inch a soldier;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fond o’ his country, fond o’ his queen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ hawfully fond o’ me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But to-day there is nothing of the soldier in the
pose or gait of Tom Hammond.</p>

<p>Yet the time and place ought to have held his attention
sufficiently to have kept him alert to outward appearance.
It was eleven in the forenoon. The place was
Piccadilly. He came abreast of Swan and Edgar’s. The
pavement was thronged with women on shopping bent.
More than one of them shot an admiring glance at him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
for he had the face, the head, of a king among men.
But he had no eyes for these chance admirers.</p>

<p>Tom Hammond was thirty years of age, a journalist,
and an exceptionally clever one, at the time we make
his acquaintance. He was a keen, shrewd man, was gifted
with a foresight and general prescience that were almost
remarkable, and hence was commonly regarded by his
journalistic friends as “a coming man.” He had strongly-fixed
ideas of what a great daily paper should be, but
never having seen any attempt that came within leagues
of his ideal, he longed—lusted would not be too strong
a term—for the time and opportunity when, with practically
unlimited capital behind him, and with a perfectly
free hand to use it, he could issue his ideal journal.</p>

<p>This morning he seems farther from the goal of his
hopes than ever. For two years he had been sub-editor
of a London daily that had made for itself a great name—of
a sort. There were certain reasons which had
prompted him to hope, to expect, the actual editorship
before long. But now his house of cards had suddenly
tumbled about his ears.</p>

<p>A change had recently taken place in the composition
of the syndicate that financed the journal. There were
wheels within wheels, the existence of some of which he
had never once guessed, and which in their whirling had
suddenly produced unexpected results. The editor-in-chief
had resigned, and the newly elected editor proved
to be a man who had, years before, done him, Tom Hammond,
the foulest wrong one journalist can do to another.</p>

<p>Under the present circumstances there had been no
honourable course open for Hammond but to resign.
That morning he had found his resignation not only
accepted, but he found himself practically dismissed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>Enclosed in the letter of acceptance of his resignation
was a cheque covering the term of his notice,
together with the intimation that his services would cease
from the time of his receipt of the cheque.</p>

<p>His dejection, at that moment when we meet him,
was caused not so much at finding himself out of employment
as from the consciousness that the new editor-elect
had accomplished this move with a view to his
degradation in the eyes of his profession—in fact, out
of sheer spite.</p>

<p>To escape the crowd that almost blocked the pavement
in front of Swan and Edgar’s windows, he turned
sharply into the road, and literally ran into the arms of
a young man.</p>

<p>“Tom Hammond!”</p>

<p>“George Carlyon!”</p>

<p>The greeting flew simultaneously from the lips of the
two men. They gripped hands.</p>

<p>“By all that’s wonderful!” cried Carlyon, still wringing
his friend’s hand. “Do you know, Tom, I am actually up
here in town for one purpose only—to hunt you up.”</p>

<p>“To hunt me up!”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s get out of this crush, old man,” interrupted
Carlyon.</p>

<p>The pair steered their way through the traffic, crossed
the Circus, stopped for a moment at the beautiful Shaftesbury
Fountain, then struck across to the Avenue. In
the comparative lull of that walk Carlyon went on:</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve run up to town this morning to find you
out and ask you one question: Are you so fixed up—excuse
the Americanism, old boy. I’ve a dashing little
girl cousin, from the States, staying with my mother,
and—well, you know, old fellow, how it is. Man’s an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
imitative creature, and all that, and absorbs dialect
quicker than anything else under the sun. But what I
was going to say was this: are you too fixed up with
your present newspaper to forbid your entertaining the
thought of a real plum in the journalistic market?”</p>

<p>Hammond’s customary alert look returned to his face.
He was now “every inch a soldier,” as he cried, excitedly,
“Don’t keep me in suspense, Carlyon; tell me quickly
what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Let’s jump into a gondola, Tom. I can talk better
as we ride.”</p>

<p>Carlyon had caught the eye of a cab-driver, and the
next moment the two friends were being driven along
riverwards.</p>

<p>“Someone, some Johnnie or other,” began Carlyon, as
the two men settled themselves back in the cab, “once
called the hansom cab the gondola of London’s streets——”</p>

<p>He caught the quick, impatient movement of Hammond’s
face, and with a light laugh went on:</p>

<p>“But you’re on thorns, old boy, to hear about the journalistic
plum. Well, here goes. You once met my uncle,
Sir Archibald Carlyon?”</p>

<p>Hammond nodded.</p>

<p>“He is crazy to start a daily,” said Carlyon. “It is
no new craze with him; he has been itching to do it for
years. And now that gold has been discovered on that
land of his in Western Australia, and he is likely to be
a multi-millionaire—the concessions he has already sold
have given him a clear million,—now that he is rich
beyond all his dreams, he won’t wait another day; he
will be a newspaper proprietor. It’s a case of that
kiddie in the bath, Tom, doncher-know, that’s grabbing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
for the soap—‘he won’t be happy till he gets it.’”</p>

<p>“He wants to find at once a good journalist, who is
also a keen business man; one who will take hold of
the whole thing. To the right man he will give a perfectly
free hand, will interfere with nothing, but be
content simply to finance the affair.”</p>

<p>An almost fierce light was burning in the eyes of the
eager, listening Hammond. A thousand thoughts rioted
through his brain, but he uttered no word; he would
not interrupt his friend.</p>

<p>“I told Nunkums last night, when he was bubbling
and boiling over with his project, that I had heard you
say it was easier to drop a hundred or two hundred
thousand pounds over the starting of a new paper than
perhaps over any other venture in the world.</p>

<p>“Nunkums just smiled as I spoke, dropped a walnut
into his port glass, and said quietly, ‘Then I’ll drop
them.’</p>

<p>“He hooked that walnut out of his wine with the
miniature silver boathook—he had the thing made for
him for the purpose,—devoured the wine-saturated nut,
then smiled back into my face, as he said: ‘Yes, Georgie,
I am quite prepared to drop my hundred, two hundred,
three hundred thousand, if needs be, as I did my walnut.
But I am equally hopeful—if I can secure the right man
to edit and manage my paper,—that I shall eventually
hook out an excellent dividend for my outlay. I want a
man who not only knows how to do his own work well,
as an editor, but one who has the true instinct in choosing
his staff.’</p>

<p>“Of course, Tom, I trotted you out before him. He
remembered you, of course, and jumped at the idea of
getting you, if you were to be got. The upshot of it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
is, nothing would satisfy him but that I should come up
by an early train this morning—early bird catches the
worm, and all that kind of business, you know,—and
now, in spite of the fact that my particular worm had
wriggled and squirmed miles from his usual habitat,
I’ve caught him. Now, tell me, are you open to treat
with Sir Archibald?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and can begin business this very day!” Hammond
laughed with the abandon of a boy, as he told, in
a few sentences, the story of his dismissal.</p>

<p>“Good!” Carlyon, in his own exuberant glee, slapped
his friend’s knee.</p>

<p>“Sir Archibald,” he went on, “was to come up by the
10:05 from our place, due at Waterloo at 11:49. He’ll
be fixed up—“Hail Columbia!” again—at the hotel by
this time. That’s where we are driving to now, and—ah!
here we are!”</p>

<p>A moment later the two men were mounting the hotel
steps. One of the servants standing in the vestibule
recognized Carlyon, and saluted him.</p>

<p>“My uncle arrived, Bates?” Carlyon asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and a young lady with him!”</p>

<p>Carlyon turned quickly to Hammond.</p>

<p>“That’s Madge, my American cousin, Tom. I’m
awfully glad she has come; I should like you to know
her.”</p>

<p>Turning to the servant, he asked, “Same old rooms,
Bates?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Three steps at a time, laughing and talking all the
while, Carlyon, ignoring the lift, raced up the staircase,
followed more slowly by his friend.</p>

<p>Hammond never wholly forgot the picture of the sitting-room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
and its occupant, as he entered with Carlyon.
The room was a large one, exquisitely furnished, and
flooded with a warm, mellow light. A small but cheerful-looking
wood fire burned upon the tiled hearth, the atmosphere
of the room fragrant with a soft, subtle odour, as
though the burning wood were scented. From a couch,
as the two men entered, a girl rose briskly, and faced
them. She made a picture which Tom never forgot.
The warm, mellow light that filled the room seemed to
clothe her as she stood to meet them. “America” was
stamped upon her and her dress, upon the arrangement
of her hair, upon the very droop of her figure. She was
tall, fair, with that exquisite colouring and smoothness
of complexion that is the product of an unartificial,
hygienic life.</p>

<p>Her face could not be pronounced wholly beautiful,
but it was a face that was full of life and charm, her
eyes being especially arrestive.</p>

<p>“Awfully glad you came up, Madge!” cried Carlyon.
“I’ve run my quarry down, and this is my own particular,
Tom Hammond.”</p>

<p>He made a couple of mockingly-funny elaborate bows,
saying: “Miss Madge Finisterre, of Duchess County,
New York. Mr. Tom Hammond, of—oh, shades of
Cosmopolitanism!—of everywhere, of London just at
present.”—Tom bowed to the girl.—She returned his
salute, and then held forth her hand in a frank, pleasant
way, as she laughingly said, “I have heard so much of
Tom Hammond during the last few days, that I guess
you seem like an old acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Tom shook hands with the maiden, and for a moment
or two they chatted as freely and merrily as though they
were old acquaintances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>The voice of Carlyon broke into their chat, asking:
“Where’s Nunkums, Madge?”</p>

<p>Before the girl could reply, the door opened and Sir
Archibald entered the room.</p>

<p>One glance into his face would have been sufficient
to have told Tom the type of man he had to deal with,
even if he had not seen him before. A warm-hearted,
unconventional, impulsive man, a perfect gentleman in
appearance, but a merry, hail-fellow-well-met man in his
dealings with his fellows.</p>

<p>With a bit of mock drama in the gesture, Madge Finisterre
flourished her hand towards the newcomer, crying,</p>

<p>“Sir Archibald, George? Lo, he is here!” She
flashed a quick glance to the piano as she added, “If
only I had known you were about to enter, uncle, I
would have treated you to a few crashing bars of stage-life
entree-music.”</p>

<p>“Go away with your nonsense!” laughed the old man.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, indeed!” the girl laughed as merrily as
the old man. Then, with a sudden, swift movement,
she crossed to the piano, struck one sharp note upon it,
and whispered in well-feigned hoarseness, “Slow music
for the three conspirators as they retire to plot the
destruction of London’s press, and the accumulation of
untold millions by their own special journalistic production!”</p>

<p>Her fingers moved over the ivory keys, and low, weird,
creepy music filled the room with its eerie notes.</p>

<p>Sir Archibald and George Carlyon fell in with the
girl’s mood, and crept doorwards on tiptoe.</p>

<p>“Number three,” hissed the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>And Tom Hammond laughingly followed with the
two other men.</p>

<p>“She is a treat, is Madge!” laughed George Carlyon,
as the three men passed through the doorway and made
for the study-like room of Sir Archibald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">“THE COURIER.”</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">For</span> two hours the three men held close conference
together. At the end of that time all the preliminaries
of the new venture were settled. Tom Hammond
had explained his long-cherished views of what
the ideal daily paper should be. Sir Archibald was
delighted with the scheme, and, in closing with Hammond,
gave him a perfectly free hand.</p>

<p>“You were on the point of saying something about a
striking poster to announce the coming paper, Mr.
Hammond,” said the old baronet.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Tom replied; “I think a great deal may be
done by arresting the attention of the people—those in
London especially. My idea for a poster is this: the
name of the paper is to be ‘The Courier.’ Very well,
let us have an immense sheet poster, first-class drawing,
striking but harmonious colouring, and bold, arrestive
title of the paper and announcement of its issue. Following
the title, I would have in the extreme left a
massive sign-post, a prominent arm of the structure bearing
the legend ‘To-morrow.’ On the extreme right of
the picture I would put another sign-post, the arm of
which should bear the words ‘The Day After To-morrow.’
I would have a splendidly-drawn mounted courier,
the horse galloping towards the right-hand post, having
left ‘To-morrow’ well in the rear.”</p>

<p>The old baronet exclaimed, “Rush the thing on! Flood
the hoardings of London, Edinburgh, Manchester, Liverpool,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Birmingham, Cardiff—all the large towns, and
the smaller ones as well, if you can get hoardings big
enough. Don’t study the expense, either in the get-up or
in the issue of the picture. Don’t let the pill-sellers or
cocoa or mustard people beat us.”</p>

<p>The old man sprang to his feet and paced the floor,
rubbing his hands, crying continually,</p>

<p>“Good! good! We’ll wake old England up.
We’ll——”</p>

<p>“Toddle into lunch,” interrupted George Carlyon.
“That’s the third summons we’ve had!”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond sat next to Madge at luncheon, and
was charmed with her easy, unconventional manners.
But his mind was too full of the new paper, of the great
opportunity that had come to him so unexpectedly, to
be as wholly absorbed with the charm of her personality
as he might otherwise have been.</p>

<p>He did not linger over the luncheon table.</p>

<p>“There are one or two fellows, Sir Archibald,” he
explained, “whom I should like to secure on my staff at
once. I don’t want to lose even an hour.”</p>

<p>As he bade Madge Finisterre good-bye, he expressed
the hope that he might see her again soon, and the girl
in reply allowed her eyes unconsciously to express more
than her words.</p>

<p>“She is the most charming woman I ever met,” he
told himself, as he followed Sir Archibald into his room
for the final word for which the baronet had asked.
George Carlyon had remained behind with Madge.</p>

<p>“It was about the first working expenses I wanted
to speak to you, Mr. Hammond,” the baronet began.
They were seated in the baronet’s room.</p>

<p>“I will have fifty thousand pounds—or shall we say a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
hundred thousand?—deposited, at once, in your name at—what
bank?”</p>

<p>“Any good bank you please, Sir Archibald, so long as
the particular branch is fairly central.”</p>

<p>“Capital and Counties—how will that do?” the baronet
asked, adding, “I always bank with them myself.”</p>

<p>“That will do, sir.”</p>

<p>“How about the Ludgate Hill branch, Mr. Hammond?”</p>

<p>“Could not be better, sir.”</p>

<p>“Settled, then, Mr. Hammond!” There were a few
more words exchanged between master and man, and
then they parted.</p>

<p>As Tom Hammond strode along the Embankment
towards Waterloo Bridge, his heart was the heart of a
boy again.</p>

<p>“Is life worth living!” he cried inwardly, answering
his own question with the rapturous words: “In this
hour I know nothing else that earth could give me to
make life more joyous!”</p>

<p>People passing him saw his face radiant with a wondrous
joy. It’s rare to see peace, even, in faces in our
great cities. It is rarer still to see joy’s gleam. He
allowed his glance to flash all around him, as he murmured,
“I am glad, too, that I am in London. Who
dare say that London is dull, or grim, or sordid? Who
was it that wrote, “No man curses the town more
heartily than I, but after travelling by mountains, plain,
desert, forest, and on the deep sea, one comes back to
London and finds it the most wonderful place of them
all!”</p>

<p>“Ah! It was Roger Pocock, I believe, wrote that
sentiment. Roger Pocock, ‘I looks towards yer, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Them’s my senterments!’”</p>

<p>He laughed low and gleefully at his own merry mood.
Then as his eyes took in the river, the moving panorama
of the Embankment, and caught the throb of the mighty
pulsing of life all about him, Le Gallienne’s lines came
to him, and, while he moved onward, he murmured:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“London, whose loveliness is everywhere.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">London so beautiful at morning light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One half forgets how fair she is at night.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“London as beautiful at set of sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As though her beauty had just begun!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">London, that mighty sob, that splendid tear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That jewel hanging in the great world’s ear.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ah! of your beauty change no single grace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My London with your sad mysterious face.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He moved forward in a strange rapture of spirit. He
forgot even “beautiful London”; he was momentarily
unconscious how he travelled or whither. He might
have been blind or deaf for all that he now saw or heard.
The drone of a blind beggar’s voice reading the Scriptures,
however, presently had power to break his trance.
He paused a moment before the man.</p>

<p>“This same Jesus,” droned the blind man’s voice, “who
is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like
manner as ye have seen Him go.”</p>

<p>Hammond dropped a sixpence into the beggar’s box,
and moved away, the wonder of the words he had just
heard read arresting all his previous thoughts of his
glad success.</p>

<p>“Shall so come in like manner!” he murmured. “I
wonder what it means?”</p>

<p>The next instant a woman’s pitiful voice filled his
ear, crying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>“For the love of God, good sir, give me the price
of a piece of bread.”</p>

<p>He turned sharply towards her. Her face was haggard
and hunger-filled; her eyes were wells of despair.
He slipped his finger and thumb into the fob of his
coat. The first coin that came to his touch was a shilling.
He dropped it into the emaciated, outstretched
palm.</p>

<p>The wretched creature gazed at the coin, then at him.
Her lips moved, but no words came from them. Her
eyes filled with a rush of tears. He passed on. But
the incident moved him strangely.</p>

<p>“If Christ,” he mused, “ever comes back to earth
again, surely, surely He will deliver it from such want
and misery as that!”</p>

<p>He paused and looked back at the woman. Her face
was buried in her hands. Her form was shaking with
sobs. Curiosity tempted him to go back.</p>

<p>As he came abreast of her, a child, a girl about nine,
barefooted and tired-looking, was saying to the woman,
“What’s the matter, missis? Wouldn’t that swell giv’
yer nuffink w’en yer arst ’im?”</p>

<p>“Give me nothing?” The woman glanced down at
the child. “Why, he is kinder than Gawd, fur he give
me a shilling!”</p>

<p>At this Tom Hammond hurried away.</p>

<p>“Kinder than God!” he murmured. “Oh, God, that
we should have it in our power to buy such happiness
for so small a sum!”</p>

<p>“Kinder than God” he repeated to himself. He was
now mounting the granite steps to the bridge. “Of
course, one knows better; yet how difficult of proof it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
would become, if one had to explain it to that poor soul,
and to the thousands like her in this great city!”</p>

<p>For the first time since leaving Sir Archibald his own
joy was forgotten. The awful problem of London’s
destitution had supplanted London’s beauty in his
thoughts.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">FLOTSAM.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">“Only</span> nine hours!”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond laughed amusedly at his own
murmured thought. It seemed ridiculous almost to try
to believe that only nine hours before he had been a
discharged journalist, while now he was at the head of
what he knew would be the greatest journalistic venture
London—yea, the world—had ever seen.</p>

<p>He had just dined. He felt that he wanted some kind
of movement, some distraction, to relieve the tension.
He was in that frame of mind when some kind of
adventure was necessary, although he did not tell himself
this, being hardly conscious of his own need. He
knew that the haunts of his fellows—club, theatre, music-hall—would
only serve to irritate him. Some instinct
turned his feet riverwards.</p>

<p>It was now a quarter past seven o’clock. Night had
fallen upon London. Tom Hammond crossed the great
Holborn thoroughfare. The heavier traffic of London’s
commercial life had almost ceased. The omnibuses
going west were filled with theatregoers, and other pleasure-seekers.
Hansoms flitted swiftly either way, each
holding a man and a woman in evening dress.</p>

<p>Having crossed the roadway, he paused for a moment
at the corner of Chancery Lane, and let his eye take in
all the scene. And again Le Gallienne came to his mind,
and he softly murmured:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ah! London! London! our delight,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Soft gowns and flutter of soiled doves.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He turned with a faint sigh, and began to pass on
down Chancery Lane.</p>

<p>“Oh, London!” he mused, “thy surface may be wonderful
and beautiful; but below—what are you below
the surface?”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He moved onwards in the direction of the Law Courts.
Presently he neared the Waterloo Bridge approach.
He had, all unrealized by himself, since he left the
restaurant where he had dined, been walking towards the
river. A moment or two after, and he was leaning on
the parapet of the bridge, looking down into the dark
waters. Sluggish, oil-like in appearance, as seen in the
dull gleam of the lamps, the river moved seawards. A
sudden longing to get out upon those dark waters came
to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>“If only——” he mused. Then, turning briskly, he
came face to face with a man in a blue guernsey, who
was crossing the bridge. It was the very man of his
half-uttered thought. “If only I could run up against
Bob Carter!” he had almost said.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mister Ham’nd.” The man in the
guernsey saluted with a thick, tar-stained forefinger as
he recognized Tom Hammond.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Carter.” Hammond laughed as he
added, “I was just wishing I could meet you, for I felt
I should like to get out on the river.”</p>

<p>“I’m jes’ going as fur as Lambeff, sir. Ef yer likes
ter go wif me, you’ll do me proud, sir; yer know that,
I knows!”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the two men sat in Carter’s boat.
Hammond, in the stern, was steering. The man Carter,
on the first thwart, manipulated the oars. Hammond
had known the man about a year. He had done him a
kindness that the waterman had never forgotten.</p>

<p>“Aw’d go to ther world’s end fur yer, sir,” he had
often said since.</p>

<p>The man was ordinarily a silent companion, and to-night
after a few exchanged words between the pair, he was
as silent as usual.</p>

<p>Down the wide, turgid river the boat, propelled by
Carter’s two oars, shot jerkily, the rise and fall of the
glow in the rower’s pipe-bowl synchronizing with the
lift and dip of the oars.</p>

<p>Hammond enjoyed the silence. There was a weirdness
about this night trip on the river that fitted in
with his mood. His brain had been considerably overwrought
that day. The quiet row was beginning to
soothe the overwrought nerves. Where he sat in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
stern of the boat, he faced the clock-tower at Westminster.
The gleaming windows of the great embankment
hotels lay behind him. A myriad electric lights
were on his right hand. The gloom and darkness of the
unlighted wharfage on the Surrey side were on his left.</p>

<p>Only by a waterway miracle Carter cleared an anchored
barge that, defying the laws of the river, carried no
warning light.</p>

<p>“Drat ’em!” growled the man Carter. “They oughter
do a stretch in Portlan’ or Dartmoor fur breakin’ the
lor. There’s many a ’onest waterman whose boat’s foun’
bottom-up, or smashed to smithereens, an’ whose body’s
foun’, or isn’t, jes, as the case may be, all becos’ they
lazy houn’s is too ’ide-boun’ to light a lamp, cuss ’em!”</p>

<p>His growl died away in his throat. The glowing fire
of his pipe rose and fell quicker than ever, telling of a
fierce anger burning within him.</p>

<p>“Ssh!” he hissed. Hammond saw that his face was
turned shorewards. He heaved aft towards Hammond,
and whispered, “Kin yer see that woman, sir?” He
jerked his chin in the direction of a line of moored
barges.</p>

<p>Hammond had turned his head, and could plainly
discern the form of a woman standing on the edge of
the outer barge of the cluster.</p>

<p>The men in the boat sat still, but watchful.</p>

<p>“Do she mean sooerside, sir?” whispered Carter.
“Looks like it, sir. Don’t make a soun’.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the woman leaped into the air.
There was a low scream, a splash, a leap of foam flashed
dully for one instant, then all was still again.</p>

<p>The waterman plied his oars furiously. Hammond
steered for the spot where that foam had splashed. An<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
instant later the boat was over the place where the body
had disappeared. Carter lay on his oars, and peered into
the darkness on one side. Hammond strained his eye
on the other side.</p>

<p>With startling suddenness a hand darted upwards
within a foot of where Hammond sat in the stern of the
boat. In the same instant the woman’s head appeared.
Hammond reached out excitedly, and caught the back
hair of the woman, twisting his fingers securely into the
knot of hair at the back of her head.</p>

<p>Carter shipped his oars, and in two minutes the
wretched woman was safe in the boat. Her drenched
face gleamed white where they laid her. A low whimpering
sob broke from her.</p>

<p>“Turn ’er over on her face a little, sir, while I makes
the boat fast fur a minute or two, sir,” jerked out the
waterman.</p>

<p>“Pore soul ov ’er!” he went on, knotting his painter
to a bolt in the stern of a barge. “She ’ave took in a
bellyful of Thames water, an’ it ain’t filtered no sort,
that’s sartin!”</p>

<p>Hammond had by this time turned the woman over
on her face.</p>

<p>Carter came aft bearing a water-beaker in his hands.</p>

<p>“I’ll lift her legs, sir,” he said, “and you put this beaker
under her, jes’ above her knees; that’ll ’elp her a bit.”</p>

<p>That was done, and almost instantly the woman was
very sick.</p>

<p>“In my locker there, sir, I’ve got a drop o’ whisky.
I keeps it there fur ’mergencies like this,” said Carter.</p>

<p>Hammond moved to allow the man to reach a seat-locker
in the stern. The next minute, while Hammond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
supported the woman, the waterman poured a few drops
of the spirit down her throat.</p>

<p>She coughed and sputtered, but the draught restored
her. She began to cry in a low, whimpering way.</p>

<p>“We must get her ashore, Carter,” cried Hammond.
“I’ll take the oars, and, as you know the riverside better
than I do, just steer into the nearest landing-place you
know.”</p>

<p>Carter leaped to the bows, cast off the painter, and
hurried aft again.</p>

<p>“Jes’ ’long yere, sir, there’s an old landin’ as’ll jes’
serve us. Wots yer fink ter do wi’ the pore soul, sir—not
’and her over to the perlice?”</p>

<p>“No, neither the police nor workhouse, Carter. I
wish I could see her face, and see what kind of woman
she is.”</p>

<p>By way of reply, Carter struck a match, and lit a
small bull’s-eye lantern. When the wick had caught
light, he flashed it on the face of the woman.</p>

<p>Her eyes were closed, her face was deadly pale. Her
hair was dishevelled. But in the one flashing glance
Hammond took at her, he recognized her.</p>

<p>“It’s Mrs. Joyce!” he muttered half-aloud and in
amazed tones.</p>

<p>“Know ’er, sir?” asked the waterman.</p>

<p>“A little!” he replied. “Her husband is a reporter—a
drinking scamp.”</p>

<p>Carter shut off the light of the bull’s-eye, at that
moment.</p>

<p>“We’re jes’ ’ere now, sur, so’s best not to be callin’
’tention like wi’ a light.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>He steered the boat into a kind of narrow alley-way
between two crazy old wharves.</p>

<p class="tb">Hammond, rightly gauging the kindly heart of his
landlady, had brought the drenched woman in a cab
to his lodgings. She was still in a half-fainting condition
when he carried her into the house. In two sentences
he explained the situation to the landlady, whose
natural kindness and loyalty to her lodger made her
willing to aid his purpose of rescue.</p>

<p>“I will carry her up to the bath-room,” he said. “Let
your girl get a cup of milk heated as hot as can be sipped,
while you bath this poor soul quickly in very hot water.
Then let her be got to bed, and have some good, nourishing
soup ready. She’ll probably sleep after that.
And in the morning—well, the events of the morning will
take their own shape.”</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later, as Hammond took a cup of coffee,
he had the satisfaction of knowing that the woman he
had saved was in bed, and doing well.</p>

<p>“Poor soul!” he mused. “That brute of a husband
has probably driven her to this attempt on her life. I
wonder what her history was before she married, for I
remember how it struck me, that day when I saw her
at the office, that she was evidently a woman of some
culture.”</p>

<p>It was nearly ten now. He had no desire to go out
again. It wanted two hours quite to his usual bed-time.
But a strange sense of drowsiness began to steal over
him, and he went off to his bed.</p>

<p>“What a day this has been!” he muttered, as he laid
his head on the pillow.</p>

<span class="smaller">“I ONLY REAPED WHAT I SOWED.”</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Hammond</span> awaited the woman whom he had saved
from drowning.</p>

<p>“She has slept fairly well,” the landlady told him,
“and I made her eat a good breakfast that I carried up
to her myself, Mr. Hammond!”</p>

<p>Now he waited to speak to her. A moment or two
more, and the landlady ushered her into the room, then
slipped away.</p>

<p>“How can I ever repay you, sir!” cried the woman,
seizing the hand that Hammond held out to her.</p>

<p>For a moment or two her emotion was too great for
further speech. Hammond led her to an armchair and
seated her. She sobbed convulsively for a moment or
two. He allowed her to sob. Presently tears came. The
paroxysm passed, the tears relieved her, and she lifted
her sad, beautiful eyes to his face.</p>

<p>“You know—oh, yes, you must know, Mr. Hammond—(I
recognized you last night)—how I came to be
in the water. I tried to take my life. I was miserable,
despairing! God forgive me.”</p>

<p>His strong eyes were full of a rare tenderness, as
he said, “But, Mrs. Joyce, you surely know that death
is not the end of all existence. I am not what would
be called a religious man, but every fibre of my inward
being tells me that death does not end all.”</p>

<p>He saw a shiver pass over her, as she hoarsely replied,
“I, too, realize that this morning, Mr. Hammond. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
last night the madness of an overwhelming despair was
upon me. My life had been a literal hell for years,
until yesterday I could bear it no longer. I was famished
with hunger, sick with despair, and——”</p>

<p>She sighed wearily. “Perhaps,” she went on, “if you
knew all I have borne, you would not wonder at my
rash, mad act.”</p>

<p>“Tell me your story, Mrs. Joyce,” he said, gently. “It
may relieve your overcharged heart, and, anyhow, I will
be your friend, as far as I can.”</p>

<p>She sighed again. This time there was a note of
relief, rather than weariness, in the sigh.</p>

<p>“My father was a well-to-do farmer,” she began, “in
North Hants. I was the only child, and I fear I was
spoiled. I received the best education possible, and
loved my studies for their own sake, for culture, in all
its forms, had a strong attraction for me. I had been
engaged to a young yeoman farmer for nearly a year.
I had known him all my life, and we had been sweethearts
even as children. Then there came suddenly
into my life that man Joyce, for whom I sacrificed everything.
God only knows how he contrived to exercise
such an awful fascination over me as to make me leave
everyone, everything, and marry him.”</p>

<p>For a moment she paused, and shuddered. Her voice,
when she spoke, again, was hollow, and full of tears.</p>

<p>“I killed my father by eloping on the very eve of
my arranged marriage with Ronald Ferris. Ronald left
the country as soon as he could wind up his affairs.
And I—well, here in this mighty Babylon, I have ever
since been reaping some of the sorrow I had sown.
Not a penny of my father’s money ever reached me,
and that brute Joyce only married me for what he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
expected to get with me. He has done his best to make
earth a hell for me, and I, in my mad blindness, last
night, almost exchanged earth’s fleeting hell for God’s
eternal hell.”</p>

<p>A look of shame filled her eyes as she lifted them
to Hammond.</p>

<p>“What you reminded me of just now, Mr. Hammond,
I, deep down in my soul, know only too well—that
death does not end all. My father was a true
Christian, and a lay preacher. I have travelled with
him hundreds of times to his preaching appointments,
playing the harmonium and singing solos for him in
his services. More than once the sense of God’s claim
upon me was so great as almost to compel my yielding
my heart and life. Would to God I had! But my
pride, my ambitions, strangled my good desires, and, as
I said just now, I broke my father’s heart. I killed
him, and ruined all my own life, though I have no pity
for myself. Then London life, my husband’s brutality,
my own misery, all helped to drive even the memory of
God from my mind.”</p>

<p>“Yet,” broke in Hammond, “the Christian religion
teaches that sorrow and suffering ought to drive the
possessor of the faith nearer to God.”</p>

<p>There was a hint of apology in his tones as he went
on:</p>

<p>“Don’t misunderstand me, Mrs. Joyce; I only speak
from hearsay. I have heard parsons preach it, but I
know nothing experimentally about these things myself.”</p>

<p>She smiled in a slow, sad way, and, catching her
breath in a kind of quick sob, said: “Neither have I
ever known anything experimentally of these truths.
I drifted into the outward form of a correct, religious,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
life. I learned to like the brightness of our chapel
services, the fun of choir practice, the merry company,
the adulation heaped upon me for my solo-singing. Then
there were the tea-meetings, the service of song, and
a multitude of other mild excitements which went to
brighten the monotony of a rural existence. But of
God, of Christ, of the Divine life, I fear I knew
nothing.”</p>

<p>Hammond smiled inwardly as he listened to this strange
confession. The phraseology was new to him.</p>

<p>“It is the shibboleth of Nonconformity, I suppose,” he
told himself. “And I suppose each section of religious
society has its own outward form of things in which
it trusts, thinking, caring, nothing for the great Divine
verities that should be the true religious life.”</p>

<p>He did not utter his thoughts aloud, but asked with
some apparent irrelevance, “Where is your husband,
Mrs. Joyce?”</p>

<p>“Off on one of his drinking bouts, or maybe, locked
up for drunkenness; I cannot say.”</p>

<p>Her lifted eyes were full of beseeching, as she went
on, “You will keep secret, Mr. Hammond, all this wild,
mad episode of my life. If only I could know that the
sad, mad, bad story was locked up between God and
you, your kind landlady and myself, I think I could go
back and face my misery better.”</p>

<p>“Do not fear, Mrs. Joyce,” he replied quickly. “The
affair shall be as though it had never been. I can answer
for Mrs. Belcher, my landlady; and for myself I give
you my word, and——”</p>

<p>“God reward you, sir!” she sobbed. “Already you
have given me clearer views of Him than any minister
or any sermon ever did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>A few moments later Mrs. Joyce rose to leave. He
pressed three sovereigns into her hand, and in spite of
her tearful protestations made her take the money.</p>

<p>“If you are ever in desperate need, come to me, or
write me, Mrs. Joyce, and I will help you, if I can.
Meanwhile, be assured that the little I have done for
you I would have done for any stranger, for, after all,
the human race is linked by a strange, a mighty family
tie. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>She wrung the hand he gave her, then with a sudden,
impulsive movement she lifted it sharply to her lips
and kissed it with a tearful passionateness.</p>

<p>The next moment she was gone. His hand was wet
with her tears.</p>

<p>“Poor soul!” he muttered.</p>

<p>Passing across the room to the window, he glanced
out. She was moving down the street. Her handkerchief
was pressed to her eyes.</p>

<p>“How strange,” he murmured, as he turned from
the window, “are these chance encounters in life! Like
ships at sea, we sight, hail, exchange some kind of
greeting, then pass on. Do we, after all, I wonder,
unconsciously influence each other in these apparently
trivial life-encounters? If so, how? Take this episode
now, for instance. Will my encounter with that poor
soul have any effect on my life, or on hers? If so,
what?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">LILY WORK.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">The</span> room we now enter is a large one. It is close
under the roof of a house in Finsbury. The man
there at work pauses for a moment.</p>

<p>The room is a workshop. The man is a Jew—but
what a Jew! He might have posed to an artist as a
model, a type of the proudest Jewish monarch over
Israel. Face, form, stature—not even Saul or David or
Solomon could have excelled him.</p>

<p>The room held the finished workmanship of his hands
for the three past years. And now, as he paused in
his labour—a labour of love—for a moment, and drew
his tall form erect, and lifted his face to the window
above him, a light that was almost holy filled his eyes.</p>

<p>“God of our fathers,” he murmured, “God of the
Holy Tent and of the Temple, instruct me; teach my
fingers to do this great work.”</p>

<p>He let his hands fall with an almost sacred touch
upon the chapiter he had been chasing. He wist not
that his face shone with an unearthly light, as for a
moment his lips moved in prayer. Then quietly reaching
a thick old book from a shelf, he opened it at one
of its earlier pages, and read aloud.</p>

<p>“And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, See, I
have called by name Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son
of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: and I have filled him
with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding,
and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
silver, and in brass, and in cutting of stones, to set
them, and in carving of timber, to work in all kinds of
workmanship. And I, behold, I have given with him
Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan:
and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I have put
wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded
thee: the tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark
of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon,
and all the furniture of the tabernacle.”</p>

<p>The light—it was now almost a fire—deepened in his
eyes. A rare, a rich, cadence filled his voice as he read
the holy words. His fingers moved to the middle of
the book. It easily opened at a certain place, as
though it had been often used at that page. Again he
read aloud:</p>

<p>“And the chapiters that were upon, the top of the
pillars were of lily work, ... and the chapiters upon
the two pillars had pomegranates also above, ... and
the pomegranates were two hundred, in rows round
about upon the other chapiter, ... and he set up the
pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the
right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin (”He
shall establish“); and he set up the left pillar, and
called the name thereof Boaz (”In it is strength“).
And on the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the
work of the pillars finished.”</p>

<p>With a reverent touch the man closed the book,
replaced it on the shelf, then, lifting his eyes again to
where the cold, clear light streamed down through the
great skylight in the ceiling, he murmured:</p>

<p>“How long, O Lord, shall Thy people be cast off and
trodden down, and their land, Thy land, be held by the
accursed races?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>For a moment a look of pain swept into his face.
Then, as he became conscious of the touch of his lowered
hand upon the chapiter, his eyes travelled downwards
to the exquisite “lily work,” and the light of a new
hope swept the pain off his face.</p>

<p>“The very fact that the time has come,” he murmured,
“for us to be preparing for the next temple, is
a token from Jehovah that the day of Messiah draweth
nigh.”</p>

<p>His eyes lingered a moment on the rare and beautiful
workmanship, then he took up a chasing tool and continued
his toil; yet, while he worked he kept up a
running recitative of Ezekiel’s description of the great
temple—for he knew by heart all the chapters of that
prophet.</p>

<p>As he presently repeated the words: “And the Prince
in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and
when they go forth, shall go forth,” he lifted his eyes
with a deep holy rapture shining in all his face.</p>

<p>He closed his recitative with a ringing note of triumph
in his voice, as he cried, “It shall be round about
eighteen thousand cubits: and the name of the city from
that day shall be Jehovah-Chammah”—“The Lord is
there.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of absolute silence. The graver
was still, the hand that held it might have been stone,
so rigid did it become. The lips of Abraham Cohen
moved, but no other sound came from him save the
words “Jehovah was there,” and he prayed aloud.</p>

<p>In the midst of his rapt devotion the door of the
workroom opened. The slight sound aroused the dreamer.
He turned his face in the direction of the door, and
his eyes flashed with pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, Zillah!” he cried in greeting. The girl he
addressed closed the door, thus shutting out the odour
of frying fish. She crossed the floor quickly, with a
certain eagerness, and came towards him with a rare
grace. She was singularly beautiful, of an Eastern style
of beauty. Her complexion was of the Spanish olive
tone, and her melting eyes were of that same Spanish
type. Her hair—a wondrous crown of it—was blue-black.
She had a certain plumpness of form that seemed
to add rather than take from her general beauty. She
was sister to his wife.</p>

<p>“Supper will be ready in five minutes, Abraham,” she
began. “Will you be ready for it?”</p>

<p>He smiled down into her great black eyes. He was
never very keen on his meals. He ate to live only; he
did not live to eat. She knew that, and had long since
learned that his labour of love was as meat and drink
to him. Her eyes glided past him and rested on his
work.</p>

<p>“It is very beautiful, Abraham!” she cried. There
was reverence as well as rapture and admiration in her
voice and glance.</p>

<p>“It cannot be too beautiful, Zillah,” he returned.</p>

<p>Her eyes were on his work. His were on her face.
He read in it the rapturous admiration of his workmanship.</p>

<p>“When will the Messiah come?” she sighed.</p>

<p>“Soon, I believe!” he returned. “Jehovah rested in
His creative work after six days’ labour. A thousand
years with Him are as one day. May it not well be,
then, that as there have passed nearly six thousand years
(each thousand years, representing one day) that He
will presently rest in His finished work for His people,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
through the coming of the Messiah, as He did at
the creation?”</p>

<p>He laid his tool aside, and turned to the beautiful
girl, as he continued:</p>

<p>“Besides, do not our sacred books say that when three
springs have been discovered on Mount Zion, Messiah
will come? Two springs have lately been discovered by
the excavators in Jerusalem, and our people out there
excitedly watch the work of these men, expecting soon
the discovery of the third spring.”</p>

<p>Her eager, parted lips told how she hung upon his
speech. He smiled down gratefully into her great
black lustrous eyes, though a sigh escaped him as he
said:</p>

<p>“Ah! I wish Leah would only show a little of the
interest in all this, that you do, Zillah!”</p>

<p>“You must not blame Leah too much, Abraham,” the
girl answered quickly. “She has her children, you know.
Mother always said that if ever Leah had babies, that
there would be nothing else in the world for her except
the babies. Besides, Abraham, no two of us are constituted
alike, and Leah is what the Gentiles about here
call happy-go-lucky. But, Abraham, tell me more of
what you think of Messiah’s coming. Leah’s five minutes
will be sure to run to a quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p>“I do think Messiah is coming soon,” cried the young
fellow excitedly. “Who knows? Perhaps when the
Passover comes again, and we set His chair, and open
the door for Him to enter, that He will suddenly come.
Did I tell you, Zillah, about the date discovery at Safed,
in Palestine?”</p>

<p>“No, what is it?” The girl’s face glowed with a
strange earnestness, her voice rang with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>“Safed,” he went on, quickly, “is a little town to the
north-west of Galilee. Our Rabbi there has discovered
from our sacred books, that Messiah’s coming, and the
overthrow of our enemies, will be in the year five thousand
six hundred and sixty-six—nineteen hundred and
six according to the Gentile reckoning. Our Father
Moses, and all the children of Israel sang, when Jehovah
delivered them from the Red Sea:—‘Yea, by the force
of Thy swelling waves hast Thou demolished those who
arose against Thee. Thou didst discharge Thy wrath,
it devoured them up like stubble.’ Our Rabbis—and
even the Christian Gentile teachers—agree that the deliverance
of our race from Pharaoh, and the destruction of
his hosts, picture our race’s future as well as its past.
And the numerical value of ‘Thou shalt overthrow’ (part
of those two song-stanzas I have just repeated) gives
the date I have mentioned as the time of our deliverance
from all our troubles, when Messiah shall come.”</p>

<p>There was a sudden clatter of little feet outside at
that moment, and a boy and a girl burst into the room.</p>

<p>“What do you think, father?” cried the boy, with the
excited impulsiveness of a child bursting with news.
“A boy—he’s a Gentile, of course—whom I know says
that Messiah has come, that the cursed Nazarene was
He, and that——”</p>

<p>“We will go to supper, Reuben, and you and I will
talk about that another time.” Cohen spoke quietly to
his boy. He had his own reasons for checking the
subject at that time.</p>

<p>His aunt caught the boy’s hand, and danced with
him out of the room. Rachel, the little girl, a wondrous
miniature of Zillah, clung to her father, and the whole
family trooped off to wash their hands before the meal.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">AN INTERESTING TALK.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">“The</span> Courier” was now an established fact. As
a newspaper it was as much a revelation to the
journalists as to the general public. London had taken
to it from the first moment of its issue. The provinces,
instead of following their usual course of waiting to see
what London did, took their own initiative, and adopted
the new paper at once. Every instinct about the ideal
paper, felt and nursed during the waiting years by Tom
Hammond, had been true instinct. He had always felt
them to be true; now he realized the fact. He was a
proud man, a happy man.</p>

<p>One curious feature of the new journal had attracted
much attention, even before the publication of the first
issue. In his “Foreword,” as he had termed it, in a
full page announcement that appeared in three of the
leading London dailies, Tom Hammond had said:</p>

<p>“An important feature of the ‘Courier’ will be the
item or items (as the case may be) which will be found
each day under the heading, ‘From the Prophet’s
Chamber.’ A greater man than the editor of ‘The
Courier’ once said, ‘Every editor of a newspaper ought
to have a strain of the seer in his composition. He
ought to have the gift of prophecy up to a certain
point. He ought to be so thoroughly conversant with
the history of his own and every other nation that
when history is on the point of repeating itself—as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
has a habit of doing,—he may not be caught altogether
napping.’ It is the unexpected that happens, we say.</p>

<p>“True, but there are many of the so-called happenings
of the unexpected that to the spirit of the seer
will have been expected and more than half-prophesied.</p>

<p>“Now, while we propose that the whole tone of ‘The
Courier’ shall show the spirit of the seer in a measure,
we shall endeavour to make the particular column to
which we are now alluding essentially new. In it we
shall deal with every class of subject likely to prove
mentally arrestive to our readers, and shall make it
prophetic up to the limits of our capacities as man,
citizen and editor. How far the possession of the
quality of the seer will be found in us we must leave
the future—and our readers—to decide. But we certainly
anticipate that ‘The Prophet’s Chamber’ column
will be one of the most popular features of what we
shall aim to make the most popular paper of the
day.”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond was no believer in luck. He had
left nothing to chance in the production of his paper.
There was not a department left to subordinates which
he did not personally assure himself was being carried
out on the best, the safest, lines. For weeks he literally
lived on the spot where his great paper was to be
produced, taking his meals and sleeping at an hotel close
by the huge building that housed “The Courier.”</p>

<p>He saw very little of Sir Archibald Carlyon during
these weeks, and nothing at all of George, or the fair
American, Madge Finisterre. George was in Scotland;
Madge on the Continent.</p>

<p>His thoughts often turned to the American girl, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
his eye brightened and his pulse quickened whenever
he heard of her from Sir Archibald.</p>

<p>Once he had been permitted by Sir Archibald to
read a gossipy letter sent by her to the old baronet.
He laughed over a quotation in that letter.</p>

<p>“I am not like the Chicago girl,” she wrote, “of
whom our Will Carleton writes, who, telling all about
her tour in ‘Urop,’ says,</p>

</div>

<p>“I feel,” Madge had written, “that one wants a life-time
to ‘do’ the Continent.”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond’s thoughts often flew to the gay girl.
This morning, having seen a review of Carleton’s latest
book of ballads, he had been reminded of her, and he
laid down his pen a moment, as he gave himself up to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
a little reverie about her. An announcement aroused
him.</p>

<p>“Miss Finisterre and Mr. Carlyon, sir.”</p>

<p>He smiled to himself. “Talk of angels, etc.,” he mused.</p>

<p>The next moment he was greeting his callers. Madge
Finisterre looked, in Tom Hammond’s eyes, more radiant
now than ever.</p>

<p>“Fancy, Mr. Hammond,” she laughed, when the greetings
were over, “George and I met at Dover! He had
come south to see a friend off from Dover, and was
on the pier when I landed from the Calais boat. We’ve
been down to that dear old country house, but I wanted
to do some shopping, and to see how you looked as
editor-in-chief and general boss of the biggest daily paper
in the world.”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond’s eyes flashed with a pleased light
at her confession, which implied that she had thought
of him, even as he had thought of her. He noted, too,
how an extra shade of colour warmed the clear skin of
her cheeks as she made her confession.</p>

<p>“Because,” she went on, “all the world declares that
‘The Courier’ is the premier paper of the world, and
everyone who is anyone—in the know of things, I mean—knows
that Mr. Tom Hammond is ‘The Courier.’”</p>

<p>The talk, for a few minutes, was “shop.”</p>

<p>“You don’t go in for a column of comic,” Madge
presently said. “If you did, I could give you an item,
we, George and I, heard in the train as we ran up to
town. There were two of your English parsons in our
carriage, talking in that high-faluting note that always
reminds me of your high-pitched church service,—‘dearly-beloved-brethren’
note.</p>

<p>“Well, the two parsons were telling yarns one against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
the other—chestnuts were cheap, I assure you,—and one
of them told a story he tacked on to General Booth—the
last time I heard it, it was told of Spurgeon. He
said that the General was going down Whitechapel, and,
seeing the people pouring into a show, and wondering
what there was so powerfully attractive to the masses
in these shows, he determined to go into this particular
one. It was advertised as a ‘Museum of Biblical Curiosities.’
Just as he got in, the showman was exhibiting
a very rusty old sword, and saying,</p>

<p>“‘Now, yere’s a werry hinterestin’ hobject. This is
the sword wot Balaam ’it ’is hass wiv, ’cos ’ee wouldn’t
go.’ Booth speaks up, and says,</p>

<p>“‘Hold hard there, my friend; you’re getting a little
mixed. Balaam hadn’t got a sword. He said, “Would
that I had a sword.”’</p>

<p>“‘That’s all right, guv’nor,’ cried the showman; ‘this
is the sword ’ee wished ’ee ’ad.’”</p>

<p>The girl’s mimicry of the coster-showman’s speech was
inimitable, and the two men laughed as much at her
telling as at the tale itself.</p>

<p>George Carlyon got up from his seat, saying, “But
I say, you two, do you mind if I leave you to amuse
each other for an hour? I want, very much, to run
down to the club. I’ll come back for you, Madge, or meet
you somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Bless the boy!” she laughed. “Do you think I was
reared in an incubator, or in your Mayfair? Haven’t
you learned that, given a Yankee girl’s got dollars under
her boots to wheel on, it ain’t much fuss for her to
skate through this old country of yours, nor yet through
Europe, come to that, even though she has no more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
languages under her tongue than good plain Duchess
county American. I told the ‘boys’ that before I left
home.”</p>

<p>George Carlyon laughed, as, accepting his release, he
nodded to the pair and left the room.</p>

<p>It was a strangely new experience to Tom Hammond,
to be left alone with a beautiful and charming
woman like Madge Finisterre.</p>

<p>The picture she made, as she moved round the room
looking at the framed paintings, all gifts from his artist
friends, came to him as a kind of revelation. When he
had met her that day in the Embankment hotel, he had
been charmed with her beauty and her frank, open,
unconventionality of manner. He had thought of her
many times since—only that very day, a moment before
her arrival,—thought of her as men think of a picture
or a poem which has given them delight. But now he
found her appealing to him.</p>

<p>She was a woman, a beautiful, attractive woman.
She suggested sudden thoughts of how a woman, loved,
and returning that love, might affect his life, his happiness.</p>

<p>Her physical grace and beauty, the exquisite fit of her
costume, the perfect harmony of it—all this struck him
now. But the woman in her appealed strongest to
him.</p>

<p>“Awfully good, this sketch of street arabs!” she turned
to say, as she stood before a clever bit of black-and-white
drawing.</p>

<p>An end of a lace scarf she was wearing caught in a
nail in the wall. He sprang forward to release the scarf.
It was not readily done, for his fingers became infected
with a strange nervousness. Once their hands met, their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
fingers almost interlocked. A curious little thrill went
through him. He lifted his eyes involuntarily, and met
her glance. A warm colour shot swiftly into her face.
And he was conscious at the same moment that his own
cheeks burned.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll sit down before I do any more mischief,”
she laughed.</p>

<p>Woman-like, she was quicker to get at ease than he
was.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Mr. Hammond,” she went on, as she
seated herself in a revolving armchair, “I just wanted
very much to see how you were fixed up here, and how
you looked now that you are a big man.”</p>

<p>He made a deprecatory little gesture.</p>

<p>“Oh, but you are a really great man,” she went on.
“I have heard some big people talk of you, and say——”</p>

<p>She leaned back, and smiled merrily at him, as she
went on,</p>

<p>“Well, I guess if there’s only a shadow of truth
in the old saying, then your ears must often have
burned.”</p>

<p>Madge Finisterre gave the chair in which she was
sitting a half twist.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you British people go in for rockers?”
she asked. “I simply can’t enjoy your English homes
to the full, for want of a good rocker, wherever I go.”</p>

<p>An indiarubber bulb lay close to his hand. He pressed
it without her noting the movement. A clerk suddenly
appeared. Hammond looked across at Madge, with an
“Excuse me, Miss Finisterre, one moment.”</p>

<p>He drew a sheet of notepaper towards him. The
paper was headed with “The Courier” title and address.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>“Send me, at once, unpacked and ready for immediate
use, the best American drawing-room rocking-chair
you have in stock. Send invoice, cash will follow,” etc.</p>

<p>That was what he wrote. He enclosed it in an envelope,
then on a separate slip of paper he wrote:—</p>

<p>“Take a cab, there and back, to Wallis’s, Holborn
Circus. See how smart you can be; bring the
chair, ordered, back with you.”</p>

<p>From his purse he took a four-shilling piece, and gave
the young fellow the note, the slip of instructions, and
the coin.</p>

<p>As the attendant left the room, he turned again to
Madge, who, utterly unsuspicious of the errand on which
he had sent his employee, was amusing herself with a
copy of “Punch.” She looked up from the paper as
the door closed.</p>

<p>“I like ‘The Courier’ immensely, Mr. Hammond,”
she cried. There was a rare warmth of admiration in
her tone.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Finisterre!” His eyes said more
than his words, “what do you specially like in it?”
he asked; “or is your liking of a more general character?”</p>

<p>“I do like it from a general standpoint,” she replied;
“I think it the best paper in the world. But especially
do I like your own particular column, ‘From a Prophet’s
Chamber.’ But, Mr. Hammond, about the Jew—you are
going in strong for him, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“From the ordinary newspaper point, yes,” he said.
“I cannot quite recall how my mind was first switched
on to the subject, but I do know this—that the more
I study the past history of the race, and the future
predictions concerning it, the more amazed I am, how,
past, present, and future, the Jews, as a nation, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
interwoven with everything political, musical, artistic—everything,
in fact. And I wonder, equally, that we
journalists, as a whole—I speak, of course, as far as I
know my kinsmen in letters—should have thought and
written so little about them.</p>

<p>“Take their ubiquitousness, Miss Finisterre,” went on
Hammond. “There does not appear to have been an
empire in the past that has not had its colony of Jews.
By which I do not mean a Ghetto, simply, a herding
of sordid-living, illiterate Hebrews, but a study colony
of men and women, who, by sheer force of intellect, of
brain power, have obtained and maintained the highest
positions, the greatest influence.</p>

<p>“Why, in China, even, isolated, conservative China,
before Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Jews were
a prosperous, ubiquitous people, worshipping the one
God, Jehovah, amidst all the foulness of Chinese
idolatries.”</p>

<p>Madge Finisterre listened with rapt interest. The
man before her, fired with his subject, talked marvellously.
A good listener helps to make a good talker,
and Tom Hammond talked well.</p>

<p>“It is not simply that they practically hold the wealth
of the world in their hands, that they are the world’s
bankers, but they are dominating our press, our
politics.”</p>

<p>With glowing picture of words he poured out a flood
of wondrous fact and illustration, winding up presently
with:</p>

<p>“Then you cannot kill the Jew, you cannot wipe
him out. Persecution has had the effect of stunting
his growth, so that the average Britisher is several inches
taller than the average Jew. But the life of the Hebrew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
is indestructible. Sometimes of late I have asked myself
this question, as I have reviewed the history of the
dealings of so-called Christianity with the Semitic race—Has
Christianity been afraid of the Jews, or why has she
sought to stamp them out?”</p>

<p>The pair had been so engrossed with their talk that
they had lost all count of time. A half-hour had slipped
by since Tom Hammond had sent his messenger to
Wallis’s. The young fellow suddenly appeared at the
door.</p>

<p>“Got it, Charlie?”</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply to his question, the editor
bounded from his seat and passed outside. Thirty
seconds later the door opened again, and he appeared,
bearing a splendid rocker in his arms.</p>

<p>Before she fully realized the wonder of the whole
thing, Madge found herself seated in the rocking-chair.
Swaying backwards and forwards, and blushing and
smiling, she cried:</p>

<p>“You are a wonderful man, Mr. Hammond!”</p>

<p>“You said you could never fully enjoy our English
houses for want of a rocker. Now, however ‘angelic’
your visits to this room may be, you shall have one
inducement to slip in—a rocker.”</p>

<p>She was beginning her thanks again, when he interrupted
with:</p>

<p>“But, excuse me, Miss Finisterre, what about some
tea? Shall we go out and get some, or would you prefer
that I should order it in here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, here, by all means! I can have tea at a restaurant
every day of my life, but with a real London lion—a
real live editor—and in his own special den. Why, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
may never fall to my lot again. Oh, here, by all means!”
she cried, excitedly.</p>

<p>He squeezed that rubber bulb again. To the lad
Charlie, who appeared, he gave a written order to a
neighbouring restaurant. Twenty minutes later the tea
was in the room.</p>

<p>Madge officiated with the teapot. Hammond watched
her every movement. A truly pretty, graceful girl never
looks handsomer to a man than when presiding at a tea-table.
Tom Hammond thought Madge had never looked
more charming. The meal was a very enjoyable one,
and as she poured out his second cup he paid her a pretty
compliment, adding:</p>

<p>“To see you thus, Miss Finisterre, makes one think
what fools men are not to——”</p>

<p>He paused abruptly. She flashed a quick glance of
enquiry at him.</p>

<p>“Not to what, Mr. Hammond?”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he replied, “if I ought to say what I
left unsaid?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I should not,” he laughed. “I
was going to say that, to have a bright, beautiful, graceful
woman like Madge Finisterre pouring out tea for
him, makes a man think what a fool he is not to marry.”</p>

<p>His tone and glance were alike full of meaning. She
could not mistake him. Her colour heightened visibly.
Her eyes drooped before his ardent gaze. The situation
became tense and full of portent.</p>

<p>The opening of the door at that instant changed everything.
George Carlyon had returned. At the same
moment a wire was brought to Hammond, together with
a sheaf of letters—the afternoon mail.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">“COMING.”</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">George</span> Carlyon’s entrance, the arrival of the afternoon
mail, and the telegram gave Madge Finisterre
an opportunity to escape. George Carlyon was
anxious to leave, and Madge rose at once to accompany
him.</p>

<p>Tom Hammond did not press them to stay, for he,
too, felt awkward. The friends shook hands. The eyes
of Madge and Hammond met for one instant. Each
face flushed under the power of the other’s glance.</p>

<p>When the door had closed upon them, Tom went
back to his old place by the table, his eyes involuntarily
sweeping the whole apartment. He smiled as he
suddenly realized how empty the room now seemed.
His glance rested upon the tea-tray, and he rang for
the lad Charlie.</p>

<p>“Clear all this away, Charlie, please,” he began. Then
with a smile he said, “You will find a capital cup of tea
in that pot.”</p>

<p>The boy grinned. At his first glance at the tray he
had mentally decided that he would be able to have a
rare feast. A couple of minutes, and the boy had gone.</p>

<p>Tom Hammond gathered up his mail, and was about
to drop into his ordinary seat, when he remembered
the rocker. With a smile at Madge’s occupancy of the
chair, he dropped into it.</p>

<p>For fully five minutes he sat still thinking, reviewing
all the circumstances of the peculiar situation upon which
the unexpected coming of George Carlyon had broken.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
He asked himself whether he was really in love with the
fair Madge, and whether he would have proposed to
her if her cousin had not so unexpectedly turned up? He
made no definite reply to his own questioning, but turned
to his mail.</p>

<p>The telegram he had opened at once on its receipt.
He turned now to the letters. He had opened all but
two. The last one was addressed in a woman’s hand-writing.
Breaking the envelope, he took out the letter,
and turned first to the signature on the fourth page.</p>

<p>“Millicent Joyce,” he read. “Millicent Joyce?” he
repeated. Unconsciously he had laid his emphasis on
the “Millicent,” and he forgot the “Joyce.”</p>

<p>But suddenly it came to him that the letter was from
Mrs. Joyce, the woman whom he had helped to save
from drowning on the night of that memorable day when
the great chance of his life had come to him.</p>

<p>“Poor soul!” he muttered. “I wonder what she has
written about?” The next instant he was reading the
letter.</p>

<p>Tom Hammond cast his eyes over the letter which
Mrs. Joyce had sent him, and which ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Dear Sir,</p>

<p class="indent">“I gave you my word that if ever I was in special
trouble or need I would write, or come to you for help.</p>

<p>“I did not promise you, however, that if any great
joy or blessing should come to me, that I would let
you know. I don’t think I believed any joy could ever
possibly come into my life again. But joy and wondrous
gladness have come into my life, and in an altogether
unexpected way.</p>

<p>“You will remember how I said to you in parting,
that morning, that your strong, cheery words had given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
me a clearer view of God than any sermon I had ever
listened to. That impression deepened rather than diminished
when I got home. My husband, I heard, had been
sent to Wandsworth Prison for a month, for assaulting
the police when drunk.</p>

<p>“And in this month of quiet from his brutalities, the
great joy of my life came to me. I began to attend
religious services from the very first night after my
return home. I went to church, chapel, mission hall,
and Salvation Army.</p>

<p>“One night I went to the hall of the Mission for Railway
Men. A lady was speaking that night, and God
found me, and saved me. All that I had ever heard from
my dear father’s lips, when he preached about conversion,
came back to me, and that night I passed from death
to life.</p>

<p>“The subject of the address was ‘The Coming of the
Lord.’ I listened in amazement as the lady speaker
declared that, for this age, God evidently meant that
this truth of the near coming of Christ should have
almost, if not quite, the most prominent place in all public
preaching.</p>

<p>“I was startled to hear her say that there were nearly
three hundred direct references to the second coming of
Christ in the Gospels and Epistles, and that there were
thus more than double the number of references to that
subject than even to that of salvation through the blood
of the Atonement.</p>

<p>“With her Bible in her hand, she turned readily to a
score of passages as illustrations of her statement, and
all through her address she never made a statement without
backing it up by Scripture. One thing she said laid a
tremendous grip upon me, and led me to an immediate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
decision for Christ: she said, ‘How often is the possibility
of sudden death advanced by a preacher as an
incentive to unsaved souls to yield to God!</p>

<p>“‘But how poor an argument is that compared with
the near approach of Christ! Sudden death might come
to one person in a congregation before twenty-four hours,
but in a sense, that would touch that one person only.
But if Christ came to take up His people from the earth—the
dead in Christ from their graves, the living from
their occupations, etc.,—this would affect every unsaved
soul in every part of the country, of the world, even.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Tom Hammond paused in his reading.</p>

<p>“What on earth can she mean?” he murmured, under
his breath. Then he went on from the letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I gave myself up to God there and then, Mr. Hammond,
and am seeking now to live so that, should Christ
come, even before I finish this letter, I may be ready
to be caught up to meet Him in the air.”</p>
</div>

<p>Hammond paused again.</p>

<p>“What can the woman mean?” he murmured again.
With the letter held in his hand, his eyes became fixed
upon space, his mind was searching for something that
he had recently heard or read bearing on this strange
topic. The clue seemed almost within grasp, yet for
awhile he could not recall it.</p>

<p>Suddenly it came to him. A volume of poems had
been sent to him for review, amid the excitement of the
second day’s issue of “The Courier.” He had glanced
rapidly through the book, had written a brief line for
his paper, acknowledging the receipt of the book, and
promising to refer to it fully at some later date.</p>

<p>“That book,” he mused, “had something in it about—about——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>He got up from the rocker, took his place at his table,
then wheeled about slowly in his revolving chair, and
began searching his book-case. In an instant his keen
eye picked out the volume he sought. He wheeled round
again to his table, the book in his hand.</p>

<p>He turned a moment to the title-page. “Ezekiel and
Other Poems,” he read. “By B. M.”</p>

<p>“B. M.,” he mused, “Whom have I heard writes under
those initials? Ah! I remember! Mrs. Miller.—Barbara
Miller.”</p>

<p>He ran the gilt-edged leaves rapidly through his practised
fingers, his quick eye catching enough of the running
pages to satisfy him. Suddenly he paused in his
search. His eye had lit upon what he sought, and he
began to read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="center">
“COMING.”<br />
</p>

<p>“At even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the
morning.”</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>He paused in his reading for a moment, for, like a
voice near by, the drone of that blind beggar’s reading
came to him, as he had heard it that day on the embankment.</p>

<p>“This same Jesus shall so come in like manner as ye
have seen Him go.”</p>

<p>“I remember,” he mused, “how that sentence arrested
me. My mind was utterly pre-occupied a moment before,
but that wondrous sentence pierced my pre-occupation.”</p>

<p>His eyes dropped to the poem again, and he read
on:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It may be when midnight</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Is heavy on the land,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">When the moonless night draws close,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">For it may be that at midnight</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I will come.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He read rapidly, but more eagerly interested each
moment. The next section he scarcely paused upon, but
the fourth he lingered over, and then read it the second
time:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It may be in the morning,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">I will come.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He read on with a strange, breathless interest the
next two pages of poem, then, with a sudden sense of
hush upon him, he went carefully over the concluding
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“So I am watching quietly</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Every day.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">‘Surely it is the shining of His face!’</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Beyond the sea,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Where I am working my appointed task,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">‘Only a few more shadows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And He will come.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The face of Tom Hammond, as he laid down the book,
was full of a strange, new perplexity. “Strange, very!”
he muttered. “Do you know Joyce, Mr. Simpson?” Hammond
asked a reporter. “He used to be on the staff
of the——”</p>

<p>“‘Daily Tatler,’” cried the man. “Knew him well
years ago, sir. Old school-fellows, in fact. Got wrong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
with the drink, sir. Gone to the dogs, and——”</p>

<p>“Have you seen or heard anything of him this last
month, Mr. Simpson?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He’s grown worse than ever. Magistrate at
Bow Street, committing him for three days, said fellow
ought to be put in Broadmoor. Pity his poor wife, sir.
Perfect lady, sir.”</p>

<p>“You know Mrs. Joyce, then?” Hammond queried.</p>

<p>The reporter sighed, “Rather, sir! Wished a thousand
times I could have had her for a wife, and he’d
had mine. I should have had a happier life. And
he——”</p>

<p>The man laughed grimly. “Well, he’d have had a
tartar!”</p>

<p>Hammond had heard something about the shrewish
wife Simpson had unfortunately married. But he had
learned all he wanted to know, so dismissed the poor,
ill-married fellow.</p>

<p>“I think I must call upon Mrs. Joyce, and learn more
about this strange matter of the coming Christ,” he told
himself.</p>

<p>He copied the address from the head of the letter
into his pocket-book, then turned to the last letter of
his mail.</p>

<p>This proved to be a comparatively short letter, but,
to Hammond, a deeply-interesting one. It was signed
“Abraham Cohen,” and the writer explained that he
was a Jew, who had taken the “Courier” from the very
first number, and had not only become profoundly interested
in the recent utterances of the editor in the

been impressed with the desire to write to the “Prophet.”</p>

<p>“Will you pardon me, sir,” the letter went on, “if I
say that it would be to your immense advantage, now
that your mind has become aroused to the facts and
history of our race, if you would get in touch with
some really well-read, intelligent Jew who knows our
people well, knows their history, past, present, and future,
as far as the latter can be known from our Scriptures
and sacred books. Should you care to fall in with my

<p>As he folded the letter slowly, Hammond told himself
that there was something in the letter that drew
him towards the writer.</p>

<p>“I will hunt him up, for it is evident that he is as
enthusiastic over his people’s history as he is intelligent.
I will see what to-morrow brings. Now to work.”</p>

<p>He put Cohen’s letter in his pocket, and turned to
the hundred and one editorial claims upon his time.</p>

<span class="smaller">REVERIE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of the time of the year, the evening was
almost as warm as one in June. Madge Finisterre
was on one of the wide hotel balconies overlooking the
Embankment. She had dined with her cousin, George
Carlyon, but instead of going out of town that evening
with him—he had pressed her strongly to go,—she had
elected to spend a quiet evening alone.</p>

<p>London’s roar, subdued a little, it is true, at that
hour, rose all around her where she sat. The cup of
coffee she had brought to her, cooled where it stood
upon the little table at her elbow. She had forgotten it.</p>

<p>Her mind was engrossed with the memory of the
latter part—the interrupted part—of that interview with
Tom Hammond that afternoon.</p>

<p>“What would have happened if George Carlyon had
not turned up at that moment?” she mused,—“if we
had been left alone and undisturbed another five
minutes?”</p>

<p>Her cheeks burned as she whispered softly to herself:</p>

<p>“I believe Tom Hammond would have proposed to
me. If he had, what should I have replied?”</p>

<p>A far-away look crept into her eyes. She was back
again in the little town where she had been “reared,”
as she herself would have said. We have many villages
in England larger, more populous, more busy, than her
“town,” but, then, the people of her land talk “big.”</p>

<p>Before her mind’s eye there rose the picture of her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
father’s store, a huge, rambling concern built of wood,
with a frontage of a hundred feet, and a colonnade of
turned wooden pillars that supported a verandah that
ran the whole length.</p>

<p>Every item of the interior of the store came vividly
before her mind, the very odour of the place—a curious
blend of groceries, drapery, rope, oils and colours,
tobacco,—seemed suddenly to fill her nostrils. And
in that instant, though she scarcely realized it, the first
real touch of nostalgia came to her.</p>

<p>She saw the postal section of the store littered with
men, all smoking, most of them yarning. One after
another dropped in, and, with a “Howdy, all?” dropped
upon a coil of white cotton rope, or lounged against a
counter or cask. “Dollars” and “cents” floated in speech
all around, while the men waited for the mail. It was
late that night.</p>

<p>A week before she had sailed for England, she had
gone down to the store, as she had gone every evening
about mail-time, and, entering at the end nearest her
home, she had come upon the scene that had now so
suddenly risen before her mind’s eye. She had traversed
all the narrow alley-way between the stored-up supplies,
from which the various departments were stocked,
singing as she went:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She had punctuated the chorus with a series of jerked
steps, her high heels striking the wooden floor in a kind
of castanet accompaniment. Every waiting man had
risen to his feet as she came upon them in that post-office
section, and she had answered their rising with a military
salute.</p>

<p>In the great mirror that ran from floor to ceiling of
the store, she had caught a glimpse of herself. She
recalled, even now, exactly what she was wearing that
evening—a white muslin frock, a very wide sash of rich
silk—crushed strawberry colour—about her waist, the
long ends of the sash floating behind her almost to the
high heels of her dainty bronze shoes. A knot of the
same-hued ribbon, narrow, of course, with streamers
flying, was fastened at her left shoulder. Her wide-brimmed
hat was trimmed with the same colour. She had
known that she made a handsome picture before she read
the light of admiration in the eyes of the post-office
loungers.</p>

<p>“Have you heard the news, boys?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Aw, guess we hev, Miss Madge.”</p>

<p>It was Ulysses Fletcher who had acted as spokesman.</p>

<p>In some surprise, and not altogether pleased, she had
wheeled sharply round to the lantern-jawed Ulysses
and asked,</p>

<p>“How did you hear the news, Ulysses? Dad didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
tell you, I’m sure, for he promised me I should tell you
all myself.”</p>

<p>“Met a coon down to the depot, an’ I guess he wur
chuck full o’ it, an’ ’e ups an’ tells me.”</p>

<p>“A coon told you?” she had cried in ever-increasing
amazement.</p>

<p>“Sartin, Miss Madge!”</p>

<p>“A coon!” she had repeated. “A coon—told you—down
at the depot—that—I was—going—to Europe next
week!”</p>

<p>Every eye had stared in wondering astonishment at
Madge Finisterre at her announcement that she was
going to Europe. Then there was a general laugh, and
one of the smartest of the “boys” had cried:—</p>

<p>“I low there’s been a mistake some, Miss Madge, an’
that, too, all roun’. Fact is, we’ve been runnin’ two
separate tickets over this news business, an’ thought it
wur one an’ the same. We wur talkin’ ’bout Seth
Hammond’s herd o’ hogs as wur cut up by the Poughkeepsie
express ’smarnin’.”</p>

<p>She had joined in the laugh, and then in reply to
the question of another of the men, as to whether it
was really true that she was going to “Urop,” she had
replied in the affirmative, adding, by way of explanation:</p>

<p>“I guess you all know that my momma is British, that
she belonged to what the Britishers call, ‘the Quality’.
She was the youngest sister of Sir Archibald Carlyon,
was travelling over here, out west, when she was about
my age, got fixed up in an awkward shop by half-breeds,
and was rescued by my dear old poppa. Fact, that’s
how he came to be my poppa, for she married him.
Spite of her high connections in England, she was very
poor, and she loved dad. If dear momma could only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
face the water journey, she’d go over with me.”</p>

<p>“Air you goin’ alone, Miss?” one of the boys had
asked.</p>

<p>Then—how well she remembered it to-night!—she
had given the answer, part of which she had given to
George Carlyon that very day:</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll git all right, boys, you can bet on that,
without anyone dandying around me. For I guess if
there’s one thing the Britishers are learning about our
women, it’s this—that if a United States gel’s got dollars
under her boots to wheel around on it ain’t much fuss
for her to skate through their old country, nor yet
through Europe, come to that, even if she has no more
language under her tongue than good, plain, Duchess
county American.”</p>

<p>With a merry smile, for which there had been no
scrambling, since it was shed upon them all, she had
passed on to where she knew she would find her father,
ringing her boot-heels, castanet fashion, as she sang
lightly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mary’s gone wid a coon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mary’s gone wid a coon;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Since Mary flit wid de coon.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How vividly it all came up before her in this hour
of quiet reverie! But her mind flitted swiftly to another
scene, one that had been hanging in the background of
all her thought ever since (thinking of Tom Hammond
and the interrupted conversation,) she had been reminded
of home and its happenings.</p>

<p>There had been a Donation Party for their pastor
(Episcopalian Methodist) at the house of one of the
members on the very night of the store scene. Madge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
had gone, of course. Balhang was wont to say that
a Donation Party simply could not be run without her.</p>

<p>Sitting on that Embankment hotel balcony, with eyes
fixed on the lamps, the river, the bridge, the traffic yet
seeing nothing of it all, that Donation Party all came
back to her. Things had been a bit stiff and formal at
first, as they often are at such gatherings.</p>

<p>The adults sat around and talked on current topics—how
much turkeys would fetch for Thanksgiving,
whether it would pay best to sell them plucked or
unplucked, what would folks do for cranberries for
Thanksgiving, since the cranberry crop had failed that
year—“An’ turkey wi’out cranberry ain’t wuth a twist
o’ the tongue.”</p>

<p>“An’ squash,” suggested one old man. “What’s turkey
wi’out squash? I’d most so soon hev only Boston”
(i. e., pork and beans) “fur dinner as ter go wi’out
squash wi’ turkey.”</p>

<p>The young folk had been “moping around” like draggled
chickens on a wet day when the barn-door is shut.
Then, at this juncture, Madge had burst upon the scene.
She swam into the largest room, swirling round and
round with a kind of waltz movement, to the accompaniment
of her own gay voice as she sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I said, ‘My dear, I’m glad!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said she, ‘I’m glad you’re glad!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said I, ‘I’m glad you’re glad I’m glad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is so very, very nice;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It makes it seem worth twice the price,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So glad you’re glad I’m glad!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With a gay laugh she had turned to the hostess,
saying;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>“Things want hustling a bit here, Miss Julie. Everyone
is as glum as a whip-poor-will that is fixed up with
the grippe.”</p>

<p>In the quiet of that corner of the hotel balcony she
smiled at these remembrances of her nonsense that night.
She had started the young people playing their favourite
games of “Whisper,” “Amsterdam,” etc., in two or three
of the smaller rooms; then had raced away again to the
room where the adults were sitting squarely against the
wall, as grim as “brazen images.” Dropping on to the
piano stool, she struck a few soft, tender notes, suggestive
of some very gracious hymn, then suddenly broke
into song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“Oh, dat’s so! Oh, dat’s so!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dar is nuffing ’neath de moon dat’ll satisfy dis coon.</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Like a K—I—double S, kiss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Since dat Cupid, wid his dart, made a keyhole in my heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">For dat M—I—double S, miss.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Behind a corner of the curtain the young pastor had
watched and listened. He had thought his presence
unknown to her. He was mistaken.</p>

<p>For three-quarters of an hour she had been the life
of that room. Then, suddenly, as she was singing at
the piano, the room grew very quiet. She was aroused
by a voice just behind her ear, saying:</p>

<p>“Miss Finisterre, are you going to supper with this
first batch, or will you wait the next turn?”</p>

<p>Turning, she found herself face to face with the
young pastor, the room being otherwise empty. His
gaze was very warm, very ardent. She had flushed
under the power of that gaze.</p>

<p>She had railed him on his extra seriousness, and he
had answered,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t, Madge! you must know why I am grave and
sad, to-night.” (He had never called her Madge before.)</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” she had replied.</p>

<p>“In less than a week,” he went on, “so I have heard
to-night, you leave Balhang. You are going to Europe,
and will be away long months, perhaps a year.”</p>

<p>She had gazed at him in honest wonder, not fully
grasping his meaning.</p>

<p>“Why,” she asked, “should that make you sad?”</p>

<p>He had leaned closer towards her. There was no one
to see them. The heavy door-curtain had slipped from
its hook, and shut them in. Where her hand rested on
the rounded, polished arm of the piano, his larger hand
had moved, and her white fingers were clasped in his
larger ones. His eyes had sought hers, and, under the
hypnotic power of the strong love in his eyes, she had
been compelled to meet his gaze.</p>

<p>“I thought, dear, you must have seen how, for a long
time, I had learned to love you, Madge.”</p>

<p>His clasp on her fingers had tightened. He had leaned
nearer to her still. No man’s face, save her father’s,
had ever been so close to hers before, and the contact
strangely affected her. She felt the warmth of his
breath, the heat of his clean, wholesome flesh; even the
scent of the soap he had used—or was it some perfume
in his clothing?—filled all her sense of smell.</p>

<p>The perfume was violet, and she remembered to-night
how, for many a day, she could not smell violets without
recalling that moment, and seeing again the strong, earnest,
eager face, with the fire of a mighty love burning in
the eyes.</p>

<p>To-night she heard again the yearning, pleading voice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
as he had cried: “Madge, Madge, my darling! Can
you ever guess how great is my love for you? Tell
me, dear, do you, can you, love me in return? Will
you be my wife? Will you come into all my life to
bless it? And let me be wholly yours to help, to bless,
to strengthen, to love, to cherish you? Tell me, darling!”</p>

<p>And she had cried, almost piteously:</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to answer you, pastor. It is all
so sudden. I knew, of course, that we were great friends,
and I am sure I like you very much, but—this proposal!
Why, I never dreamed that you cared for me like that,
for how could I be a minister’s wife? I am such a gay,
thoughtless, foolish little thing—I——”</p>

<p>There had followed more tender pleading, and she
had finally said, “If you love me, Homer, as you say
you do, please do not bother me any more now. Wait
until I come back from Europe—then—then——”</p>

<p>“What, Madge?” he had cried softly, eagerly.</p>

<p>“If I can honestly say ‘Yes,’” she had replied, “I will
and I will not even wait for you to ask me again.”</p>

<p>He had bent over her. His gaze held her fascinated.
She thought he was going to take toll of her lips before
his right was confirmed. But at that instant there had
come a rush of feet, a sound of many voices. The curtain
was flung aside, just as her fingers strayed over the
keys of the instrument, and the pastor succeeded in
regaining his old unseen nook.</p>

<p>“I guess Miss Julie’s waitin’ fur yer, Miss Madge,
ter go ter yer supper,” bawled an old deacon of the
church.</p>

<p>She had swept the ivory keys with rollicking touch,
and sang in gayest style:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Allow me to say Ta-ta!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I bid you good-day. Ta-ta!</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">I wish I could stay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">But I’m going away.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Allow me to say Ta-ta!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Amid the uproarious laughter of everyone in the room,
she had bounded away to supper.</p>

<p>Except for one moment, when she was leaving the
house for home, and he had helped her on with her
cloak, the pastor had not spoken again directly to her
that evening. He had managed then to whisper,</p>

<p>“God bless you, my darling! I shall pray for you,
and live on the hope I read in your eyes to-night.”</p>

<p>It was all this which had risen so strangely before her
mind, as to-night, on that hotel balcony, she had begun
to ask herself how much she really cared for Tom Hammond,
and what answer she would have given him had
he proposed to her that afternoon.</p>

<p>“I told pastor,” she murmured, “that night, that I
was not sure of myself. I am no nearer being sure of
myself now than I was then.”</p>

<p>The scene with Hammond rose up before her, and
she added: “I am less sure, I think, than ever!”</p>

<p>She gazed fixedly where the double line of lamps
gleamed on the near-distant bridge. For a moment she
tried to compare the two lives—that of an American
Methodist pastor’s wife, with endless possibilities of
doing good, and that of the wife of a comparatively
wealthy newspaper editor-manager.</p>

<p>“Should I like to marry a popular man?” she asked
herself. “I read somewhere once that popular men,
like popular actors, make bad husbands, that they cannot
endure the tameness of an audience of one.”</p>

<p>She laughed low, and a little amusedly, as she added,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
“Oh, well, Tom Hammond has not asked me to marry
him. Perhaps he never will—and—well, ‘sufficient for
the day is the evil thereof.’ Pastor once preached from
that, I remember.”</p>

<p>The night had grown cooler. She shivered a little
as she rose and passed into the lighted room beyond.</p>

<p>Two hours later, as she laid her head upon the pillow,
she murmured, “I don’t see how I could marry the
pastor! Why, I haven’t ‘got religion’ yet. I am not
‘converted,’ as these Britishers would say!”</p>

<span class="smaller">A THREAT.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Tom Hammond</span> paused before the house that
bore the number at the head of Mrs. Joyce’s letter.
It was in a mean street, and his soul went out in pity
towards the unfortunate woman, who, with all her refinement,
was compelled to live amid such squalid surroundings.</p>

<p>“And heart-starved, too,” he mused, pityingly. “Heart-starved
for the want of love, of sympathy, of the sense
of soul-union that makes life with a married partner at
all bearable.”</p>

<p>“Yus, sir; Mrs. Joss lives yere. Top floor, lef’ ’and
side. Yer kin go hup!”</p>

<p>A child had opened the door in response to his knock.
Following the directions given, Tom Hammond climbed
the dirty stairs. On the top landing were two doors.
The one on the right was fast shut; that on the left was
ajar a few inches. His approach did not seem to have
been heard. Mrs. Joyce, the only occupant of the room,
was seated at a bare deal table, sewing briskly.</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand to tap at the door, but
some impulse checked him for a moment. He had
the opportunity to observe her closely, and he did so.</p>

<p>She sat facing the window; the light shone full upon
her. She was dressed in a well-worn but well-fitting
black gown. Round her throat—how pure and white the
skin was!—she wore a white turnover collar, like a
nurse, white cuffs at her wrists completing the nurse idea.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
Her hair—she had loosened it earlier because of a
slight headache—hung in clustering waves on her neck,
and was held back behind her ears with a comb on
either side. There was a rare softness and refinement
in the pale face that drooped over her sewing. Seen as
Tom Hammond saw her then, Mrs. Joyce was a really
beautiful woman.</p>

<p>He gazed for a few moments at the picture, amazed
at the rapidity of her sewing movements.</p>

<p>“The tragedy of Tom Hood’s ‘Song of the Shirt,’”
he muttered, as he watched the gleam of the flying
needle.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, men with sisters dear!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Oh, men with mothers and wives!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is not linen you’re wearing out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But human creatures’ lives!</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Stitch, stitch, stitch,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Sewing at once, with a double thread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A shroud as well as a shirt.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Under the magnetic constraint of his fixed gaze the
woman looked towards the door. She recognized her
visitor, and with a little glad cry started to her feet.
Tom Hammond pushed the door open and entered the
room. She sprang to meet him.</p>

<p>Now that he saw her, he realized the expression
of her face had changed. Heaven—all the heaven
of God’s indwelling pardon, love, peace, had come to
dwell with her. All that she had said in her letter of
her new-found joy, was fully confirmed by her looks.</p>

<p>“How good of you to come to see me, Mr. Hammond!”
she cried, as she felt the clasp of his hand.</p>

<p>“How good of you to write me of your new-found
happiness!” He smiled back into her glad, eager eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>He took the chair she offered, and with a question
or two sought to lead her on to talk of the subject about
which he had come to see her.</p>

<p>“The very title of the subject,” Hammond explained,
“is perfectly foreign to me.”</p>

<p>“It was all so, <i>so</i> foreign to me,” she returned. Then,
as swift tears flooded her eyes, she turned to him with
a little rapturous cry, saying,—</p>

<p>“And it would all have been foreign to me for ever,
but for <i>you</i>, Mr. Hammond. I never, <i>never</i> can forget
that but for you my soul would have been in a suicide’s
hell, where hope and mercy could never have reached
me. As long as I shall live I shall never forget the
awful rush of soul-accusation that swept over me, when
my body touched the foul waters of that muddy river
that night. The chill and shock of the waters I did <i>not</i>
feel, but the chill of eternal condemnation for my madness
and sin I did feel.</p>

<p>“I saw all my life as in a flash. All the gracious
warnings and pleadings that ever, in my hearing, fell
from my sainted father’s lips, as he besought men and
women to be reconciled to God, seemed to swoop down
upon me, condemning me for my unbelief and sin. Then—then
you came to my rescue—and——”</p>

<p>Her tears were dropping thick and fast now.</p>

<p>“And—my soul—had respite given in which to—to—seek
God—because—you saved my body.”</p>

<p>Overcome with her emotion, she turned her head to
wipe away the grateful tears. When next she faced
him, her voice was low and tender, her eyes glowed with
a light that Tom Hammond had never seen in a human
face before.</p>

<p>“Now, if my Lord come,” she said softly, rapturously,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
“whether at morning, at noontide, at midnight,
or cock-crowing, I shall be ready to meet Him in the air.</p>

<p>“I used to think that if ever I was converted, I should
meet my dear father and mother at the last day, at the
great final end of all things.</p>

<p>“But now I know that if Jesus came for His people
to-day, that I should meet my dear ones to-day. For
when ‘the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven ...
the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are
alive and remain shall be caught up together with them
in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall
we ever be with the Lord.’”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond gazed at the speaker in wonder. The
glory that filled her face, the triumph and rapture that
rang in her voice, were a strange revelation to him.</p>

<p>“A starvation wage for making slop-shirts,” he mused,
“yet more than triumphing over every discomfort of
poverty by the force of the divine hope that dominates
her! What is this hope?”</p>

<p>“Tell me of this wondrous thing, Mrs. Joyce,” he
said, aloud, “that can transmute your poverty and suffering
to triumph and rapture, and your comfortless
garret to a heaven on earth.”</p>

<p>“Before I begin,” she replied, “tell me, Mr. Hammond,
have ever you seen this?”</p>

<p>From the window-shelf she reached a tiny envelope
booklet.</p>

<p>“‘Long Odds’!” he said, reading the boldly-printed
title of the book. “No; I have never seen this. It
sounds sporting, rather.”</p>

<p>“Take it, Mr. Hammond,” she went on; “if it does
nothing else, it will awaken your interest in this wonderful
subject.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>He slipped the book into his breast-pocket. She
opened her mouth to speak again, when a sound from
outside caught her ear. She started to her feet; her
face turned deadly pale. The next instant the door
was flung noisily open, and her husband entered the
room.</p>

<p>The blear-eyed, drunken scoundrel glared at the two
seated figures, then laughed evilly as he cried,—</p>

<p>“Turned religious? Oho! oho! Like all the rest of
your religious people, make a mantle—a regular down-to-your-feet
ulster—of your religion to cover every
blackness and filthiness of life.”</p>

<p>“Silence, you foul-mouthed blackguard!”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond’s lips were white with the indignation
that filled him, as he flung his command to the
man.</p>

<p>“Silence yourself, Tom Hammond!” bellowed the
drunken scoundrel. “I know you,” he went on. “You’re
a big bug now! Think no end of yourself, and of
your messing paper. Perhaps you’ll say you came to
invite me to join your staff, now that I’ve caught you
here?”</p>

<p>His sneering tone changed to one of bitterest hate, as
he turned to the white, trembling woman.</p>

<p>“You’re a beauty, ain’t you? Profess to turn saint;
then, when you think I’m clear away, you receive visits
from fine gentlemen! Gentlemen? bah! they’re——”</p>

<p>“Silence, you drunken, foul-mouthed beast!” again
interrupted Tom Hammond.</p>

<p>There was something amazing in the command that
rang in the indignant tones of his voice.</p>

<p>“Unless,” he went on, “you want to find yourself in
the grip of the law.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>For a moment or two Joyce was utterly cowed! then
the devil in him reared its head again, and he hissed,</p>

<p>“You clear out of here, and remember this; if I
have to keep sober for a year to do it, I’ll ruin you,
Tom Hammond, I will!”</p>

<p>He laughed with an almost demoniacal glee, as he
went on:</p>

<p>“I can write a par yet, you know. I’ll dip my pen in
the acid of hate—hate, the hate of devils, my beauty—and
then get Fletcher to put them into his paper. He’s
not in love with the ‘Courier,’ or with Tom Hammond,
the Editor.”</p>

<p>“You scurrilous wretch!” It was all that Hammond
deigned to reply.</p>

<p>“Good day, Mrs. Joyce!” he bowed to the white-faced
woman.</p>

<p>For her sake he did not offer to shake hands, but
moved away down the stairs.</p>

<p>He caught a hansom a few moments after leaving the
mean street. He had purposed, when he started out
that morning, to hunt up his other correspondent, the
Jew, Abraham Cohen. But after the scene he had just
witnessed, he felt quite unwilling to interview a stranger.</p>

<p>“I wish,” he mused, as he sat back in the hansom, “I
had not gone near that poor soul. I am afraid my visit
may make it awkward for her.”</p>

<p>His eyes darkened as he added: “And even for
myself. It will be very awkward if that drunken brute
puts his threat into execution—and he <i>will</i>, I believe.
Innuendo is a glass stiletto, which, driven into the victim’s
character, into his heart and then snapped off from the
hilt, leaves no clue to the striker of the blow. And a
demon like that Joyce, playing into the hands of a cur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
like Fletcher, may slay a fellow by a printed innuendo,
and yet the pair may easily keep outside the reach of
the law of libel.”</p>

<p>For the first time since the floating of the “Courier,”
his spirits became clouded.</p>

<p>“Then, too,” he muttered, “there is this sudden
breakdown of Marsden, and, for the life of me, I don’t
know where to look for a fellow, whom I could secure
at short notice, who is at all fit for the ‘Courier’s’
<i>second</i>.”</p>

<p>His face had grown moody. His eyes were full of an
unwonted depression.</p>

<p>“If only,” he went on, “Bastin had been in England,
and were to be got——” He sighed. There was perplexity
in the sigh.</p>

<p>“Where on earth can Ralph be all these years?” he
muttered.</p>

<p>He glanced out of the cab to ascertain his own whereabouts.
In two minutes more he would be at the office.</p>

<span class="smaller">IN THE NICK OF TIME.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">As</span> Tom Hammond’s cab drew up at the office,
another hansom drew up a yard ahead of his.
The occupant alighted at the same instant as did Hammond,
and glanced in his direction. Both men leaped forward,
their hands were clasped in a grip that told of a
very warm friendship. Like simultaneous pistol shots
there leaped from their separate lips,—</p>

<p>“Tom Hammond!”</p>

<p>“Ralph Bastin?”</p>

<p>The friends presently passed into the great building,
arm linked in arm, laughing and talking like holiday
school-boys.</p>

<p>“Not three minutes ago, as I drove along in my cab,
I was saying, ‘Oh! if only I could lay my hand on
Ralph!”</p>

<p>They were seated by this time in Tom Hammond’s
room.</p>

<p>“Why? What did you want, Tom—anything special?”
the bronzed, travelled Bastin asked.</p>

<p>“Rather, Ralph! My second, poor Frank Marsden,
has broken down suddenly; it’s serious, may even prove
fatal, the doctors say. Anyway, he won’t be fit (if he
recovers at all) for a year or more.”</p>

<p>He leaned eagerly towards his friend as he spoke,
and asked,</p>

<p>“Are you open to lay hold of the post?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“To-morrow, if you like!”</p>

<p>“Good!”</p>

<p>Hammond stretched his hand out. Bastin grasped it.
Then they talked over terms, duties, etc.</p>

<p>“But you, man?” said Hammond, when the last bit
of shop had been talked. “Where have you been? What
have you been doing?”</p>

<p>“Busy for an hour, Tom?” Bastin asked, by way of
reply.</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Come round to my diggings, then; not far—Bloomsbury.
We can talk as we go. I shall have time to give
you a skeleton of my adventures, to be filled in later.
Then, when we get to my hang-out, I can tell you,
when you have seen <i>her</i>, the story of my chief adventure,
for it concerns her.”</p>

<p>Hammond flashed a quick, wondering glance at his
friend.</p>

<p>“<i>Her!</i>” he said; “are you married, then?”</p>

<p>“No,” laughed Bastin, “but I’ve adopted a child. But
come on, man!”</p>

<p>The pair left the office. In the cab, talking very
rapidly, Bastin gave the skeleton sketch of his wanderings,
but saying no word of the promised great adventure.</p>

<p>Tom Hammond never forgot the first sight of his
friend’s adopted child. There was a low grate in the
room, a blazing fire of leaping, flaming coals in the
grate. Curled up in a deep saddle-bag armchair was the
loveliest girl-child Hammond had ever seen.</p>

<p>She must have been half asleep, or in a deep reverie,
but as the two men advanced into the room she sprang
from the chair, and, with eyes gleaming with delight,
bounded to meet Bastin. Wreathing her arms about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
his neck, she crooned softly over him some tongue of
her own.</p>

<p>She was loveliness incarnated. Her eyes, black as
sloes, were big, round, and wide in their staring wonder
at Hammond’s appearance. Her hair was a mass of
short curls. She was dark of skin as some Spanish
beauty.</p>

<p>Her costume lent extra charm to her appearance; for
she wore a long, Grecian-like robe of some light, diaphanous
ivory-cream fabric, engirdled at the waist with
a belt composed of some sort of glistening peacock-green
shells, buckled with frosted silver. The simple but
exquisite garment had only short shoulder-sleeves, and
was cut low round the throat and neck, and finished there—as
were the edges of the shoulder-sleeves—with a two-inch
wide band of sheeny silk of the same colour as the
shells of her belt. The opening at the neck of the robe
was fastened with a brooch of frosted silver of the same
pattern, only smaller, as the buckle of the belt.</p>

<p>From beneath the silk-bound hem of her robe there
peeped bronze slippers, encasing the daintiest little crimsoned-stockinged
feet ever used for pedalling this rough
old earth’s crust.</p>

<p>Bastin introduced the child. She gave Tom her hand,
and lifted her wondrous eyes to his, answering his question
as to her health in the prettiest of broken English
he had ever heard.</p>

<p>A moment or two later the three friends were seated—Tom
and Bastin in armchairs opposite each other, the
child (Viola, Bastin had christened her) on a low stool
between Bastin’s knees.</p>

<p>“Shall we use the old lingo—French?” Bastin asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
the question in the Bohemian Parisian they had been
wont to use together years before.</p>

<p>“As you please, Ralph,” Hammond replied.</p>

<p>“I have told you hurriedly something of where I have
been,” Bastin began. “But I have reserved my <i>great</i>
story until I could tell it to you here——” He glanced
down at the child at his feet. “I heard,” he went on,
“when at La Caribe—as everyone hears who stays long
in the place—that each year, in spite of the laws of
the whites, who are in power, a child is sacrificed to
the Carib deities, and I longed to know if it were true.</p>

<p>“During my first few week’s sojourn on the little
island of Utilla, I was able to render one of the old
priests a service, which somehow became so exaggerated
in his eyes that there was almost literally nothing
that he would not do for me, and eventually he yielded
to my entreaties to give me a chance to see for myself
the yearly sacrifice, which was due in a month’s time.</p>

<p>“During that month of waiting I made many sketches
of this wonderful neighbourhood, and became acquainted
with this little Carib maiden, painting her in three or
four different ways. The child became intensely attached
to me, and I to her, and we were always together in the
daytime.</p>

<p>“As the time drew near for the sacrifice I noticed
that the little one grew very elated, and there was a
new flash in her eyes, a kind of rapturous pride. I
asked her no question as to this change, putting it down
as girlish pride in being painted by the ‘white prince,’
as she insisted on calling me.</p>

<p>“I need not trouble you, my dear fellow, with unnecessary
details of how and where the old priest led me
on the eventful night, which was a black as Erebus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
but come to the point where the real interest begins.</p>

<p>“It was midnight when at last I had been smuggled
into that mysterious cave, which, if only a tithe of what
is reported be half true, has been damned by some
of the awfullest deeds ever perpetrated. My priest-guide
had made me swear, before starting, that whatever
I saw I would make no sign, utter no sound, telling me
that if I did, and we were discovered, we should both
be murdered there and then.</p>

<p>“We had hardly hidden ourselves before the whole
centre of the cave became illuminated with a mauve-coloured
flame that burned up from a flat brass brazier,
and seemed like the coloured fires used in pantomime
effects on the English stage. By this wonderful light
I saw a hundred and fifty or more Carib men and
women file silently into the cave, and take up their positions
in orderly rows all round the place. When they
had all mustered, a sharp note was struck upon the
carimba, a curious one-stringed instrument, and the
circles of silent savages dropped into squatting position
on their heels. Then the weirdest of all weird music
began, the instruments being a drum, a flute, and the
carimba.</p>

<p>“But my whole attention became absorbed by the
grouping in the centre of the room—the fire-dish had
been shifted to one side, and I saw a hideous statue,
squatted on a rudely-constructed, massive table, the
carved hands gripping a bowl that rested on the stone
knees of the image. The head of the hideous god was
encircled with a very curious band, that looked, from
where I stood, like bead and grass and feather work.
The face—cheeks and forehead—was scored with black,
green and red paint, the symbolic colours of that wondrous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
race that once filled all Central America.</p>

<p>“In the back part of the wide, saucer-like edge of
the bowl which rested on the knees of the statue, there
burned a light-blue flame, and whether it was from
this fire, or from the larger one that burned in the wide,
shallow brazier on the floor, I cannot positively say,
but a lovely fragrance was diffused from one or the
other.</p>

<p>“Before this strange altar stood three very old priests,
while seven women (sukias,) as grizzled as the men,
stood at stated intervals about the altar. One of these
hideous hags had a dove in her hand; another held a
young kid clasped between her strong brown feet; a
third held the sacrificial knife, a murderous-looking thing,
made of volcano glass, short in blade, and with a peculiar
jagged kind of edge; another of these hags grasped a
snake by the neck—a blood-curdling-looking tamagas, a
snake as deadly as a rattle-snake.</p>

<p>“Opposite the centre-man of the three old priests stood
a girl-child, about ten years of age, and perfectly nude.
During the first few moments the vapourous kind of
smoke that was wafted by a draught somewhere, from
the fire-pan on the floor of the cave, hid the child’s features,
though I could see how beautiful of form she
was; then, as the smoke-wreath presently climbed straight
up, I was startled to see that the child was my little
friend.</p>

<p>“In my amaze I had almost given vent to some exclamation,
but my old priest-guide was watching me, and
checked me.</p>

<p>“My little one’s beautiful head was wreathed with
jasmine, and a garland of purple madre-de-cacoa blossoms
hung about her lovely shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>“Suddenly, like the barely-audible notes of the opening
music of some orchestral number, the voice of one
of the priests began to chant; in turn the two other priests
took up the strain; then each of the seven hags in their
turn, and anon each in the first circle of squatting worshippers,
followed by each woman in the second row:
and in this order the chant proceeded, until, weird and
low, every voice was engaged.</p>

<p>“Suddenly the combined voices ceased, and one
woman’s voice alone rose upon the stillness; and following
the sound of the voice, I saw that it was the
mother of my little native child-friend. I had not noticed
her before—she had been squatting out of sight. Hers
was not the chant of the others, but a strange, mournful
wail. It lasted about a minute and a-half; then, rising
to her feet, she gently thrust the child forward towards
the altar, then laid herself face down on the floor of
the cave.</p>

<p>“The little one leaned against the edge of the altar,
and taking up, with a tiny pair of bright metal tongs,
a little fire out of the back edge of the bowl on the
knees of the god, she lighted another fire on the front
edge of the bowl, her suddenly-illuminated face filled
with a glowing pride.</p>

<p>“Then, at a signal from the head priest, the child lifted
her two hands, extended them across the altar, when
they were each seized by the two other priests, and the
beautiful little body was drawn slowly, gently over,
until the smooth breast almost touched the sacrificial fire
she had herself lighted.</p>

<p>“Then I saw the woman who had held the knife suddenly
yield it up to the head priest, and I made an
unconscious movement to spring forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>“My guide held me, and whispered his warning in my
ear: yet, even though I must be murdered myself, I
felt I dared not see that sweet young life taken.</p>

<p>“Like a man suffering with nightmare, who wants
to move, but cannot, I stood transfixed, fascinated, one
instant longer. But in that flashing instant the head
priest had swept, with lightning speed, the edge of that
hideous knife twice across the little one’s breast, and she
stood smiling upwards like one hypnotized.</p>

<p>“The priest caught a few drops of the child’s blood,
and shook them into the bowl of the god; then I saw
the little one fall into her mother’s arms; there was a
second sudden flashing of that hideous knife, a piteous,
screaming cry, and I gave vent to a yell—but not <i>voice</i>
to it,—for the watching guide at my side clapped one
hand tightly over my mouth, while with the other he
held me from flying out into the ring of devils, whispering
in my ear as he held me back,</p>

<p>“‘It is the goat that is slain, not the child.’</p>

<p>“Another glance, and I saw that this was so; one
flash of that obsidian sacrificial blade across the throat
of the kid had been enough, and now the blood was
being drained into the bowl of the god.</p>

<p>“I need not detail all the other hideous ceremonies;
they lasted for nearly two hours longer, ending with a
mad frenzied dance, in which all joined save the priests
and the mother and child.</p>

<p>“Every dancer, man and woman, flung off every rag
of clothing, and whirled and leaped and gyrated in their
perfect nudity, until, utterly exhausted, one after another
they sank upon the floor.</p>

<p>“Then slowly they gathered themselves up, reclothed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
themselves, and left the cave. And now some large
pine torches were lighted, and my guide drew me further
back, that the increased glare might not reveal our presence,
and I saw the curious ending to this weird night’s
work. The priests and their seven women sukias opened
a pit in the floor of the cave by shifting a great slab of
stone, and lowered the idol into the pit. The remains
of the kid, the sacrificial knife, and the dove were dropped
into the bowl of blood that rested on the knees of the
idol; then the sukia that had held the tamagas snake during
the whole of those hideous night hours, dropped the
writhing thing into the bowl, and the slab was lowered
quickly over the pit, every seam around the slab being
carefully filled, and the whole thing hidden by sprinkling
loose dust and the ashes from the fire over the spot.</p>

<p>“Then, as soon as the last of the performers had
cleared the cave, I followed my guide, and with a throbbing
head, and full of a sense of strange sickness, I went
to the house where I was staying.</p>

<p>“I lay down upon my bed, but could not sleep; and as
early as I dared I went round to my little Martarae’s
home—Martarae was her native name. Her mother met
me, said that the child would not come out in the sun
to-day, that I might see her for a moment if I pleased,
but that she was not very well.</p>

<p>“Sweet little soul! I found her lying on her little
bed, with a proud light in her eyes, and a very flushed
face.</p>

<p>“A fortnight later the light flesh wounds were healed.
She showed me her breast, confided to me the story, and
asked me if I did not think she had much to be proud
of.</p>

<p>“‘Will you keep a secret?’ I asked her. She gave me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
her promise, and I told her how I had seen the whole
thing, and all my fears for her.</p>

<p>“A week later she was orphaned. Her mother was
stung by a deadly scorpion, and died in an hour, and I
made the child my care.</p>

<p>“She has travelled everywhere with me ever since,
and you see how fair and sweet she is, and how beautifully
she speaks our English. She is barely twelve,
is naturally gifted, and is the very light of my life.”</p>

<p>“Would she let me see her breast, Ralph, do you
think?” Hammond asked.</p>

<p>Bastin smiled, and spoke a word to the child, and she,
rising to her feet and smiling back at him, unfastened
the broach at her throat, and, laying back her breast-covering,
showed the gleaming, shiny scars. Then as
she re-covered her chest, she said softly:</p>

<p>“Ralph has taught me that those gods were evil;
but though I shall ever wear this cross in the flesh of my
breast, I shall ever love the Christ who died on the
world’s great cross at Calvary.”</p>

<p>“It is a most marvellous story, Ralph,” he said tearing
his eyes away from the child’s clear, searching gaze.</p>

<p>“The more marvellous because absolutely true,”
returned Bastin.</p>

<p>Then, addressing Viola, and relapsing, of course, into
English for her sake, he explained who Tom Hammond
was, and that he (Ralph) was going to be associated
with him on the same great newspaper.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hammond and you, Viola, must be real good
friends,” he added.</p>

<p>“Sure, daddy!” the girl said smilingly; “I like him much
already——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>She lifted herself slightly until she rested on her knees,
and stretching one hand across the hearthrug to Tom
Hammond, she laid the other in her guardian’s, as she
went on:</p>

<p>“Mr. Hammond is good! I know, I know, for his
eyes shine true.”</p>

<p>A ripple of merry laughter escaped her, as she gazed
back into her guardian’s face, and added:</p>

<p>“But you, daddy, are always first.”</p>

<span class="smaller">“LONG ODDS.”</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">For</span> a wonder, Tom Hammond could not sleep.
Usually, when the last thing had been done, and he
was assured that everything was in perfect train for
the morning’s issue, he ate a small basin of boiled milk
and bread, which he invariably took by way of a “night-cap,”
then went to bed, and slept like a tired ploughman.
But to-night slumber would have none of him.</p>

<p>“It must be the various excitements of the day,” he
muttered. “That story of Ralph’s Caribbean child was
enough to keep a fellow’s brain working for a week.
Then there was meeting Ralph so unexpectedly, just, too,
when I so lusted for his presence and help. Then there
was that Joyce item——”</p>

<p>His mind trailed off to the scene of the morning,
every item of it starting up in a new and vivid light.
Suddenly he recalled the booklet Mrs. Joyce had given
him.</p>

<p>“I can’t sleep,” he murmured; “I’ll find that thing
and read it.”</p>

<p>His fingers sought the electric switch. The next
moment the room was full of light. He got out of bed,
passed quickly through to his dressing-room, found the
coat that he had worn that morning, and secured the
booklet.</p>

<p>He went back again to bed, and, lying on his elbow,
opened the dainty little printed thing and began to read
thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p class="center">
“LONG ODDS”<br />
</p>

<p>“You don’t say so! Where on earth has she gone?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say, sir, but it’s plain enough she <i>is</i> missing.
Hasn’t been seen since last night when she went up to
her room.”</p>

<p>I <i>was</i> put out, I own; my man on waking me had
informed me that the cook was missing; she had gone
to bed without anything being noticed amiss, and was
now nowhere to be found. She was always an odd
woman, but a capital cook. What had become of her?
The very last sort of person to disappear in this way—a
respectable elderly Scotchwoman—really quite a treasure
in the country; and the more I thought of it while I
dressed, the more puzzled I became. I hardly liked to
send for the police; and then again it was awkward,
very—people coming to dinner that day. It was really
too bad.</p>

<p>But I had scarcely finished dressing when in rushed
my man again. I do so dislike people being excited, and
he was more than excited.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, Mr. Vend has come round to see you;
his coachman has gone—went off in the night, and
hasn’t left a trace behind, and they say the gardener’s
boy is with him.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “it is extraordinary; tell Mr. Vend
I’m coming; stay, I’ll go at once.”</p>

<p>It was really past belief—the three of them! After
an hour’s talk with Vend, no explanation offered itself,
so we decided to go to town as usual.</p>

<p>We walked down to the station, and saw at once something
was wrong. Old Weeks, the stationmaster, was
quite upset: his pointsman was missing, and the one
porter had to take up his duty. However, the train<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
coming up, we had no time to question him, but jumped
in. There were three other people in the compartment,
and really I thought I was going off my head when I
heard what they were discussing. Vend, too, didn’t
seem to know if he was on his head or his heels. It was
this that startled us so: “What can have become of
them all?”</p>

<p>I heard no more. I really believe I swooned, but at
the next station—a large one—we saw consternation on
every face. I pinched myself to see if I was dreaming.
I tried to persuade myself I was. Vend looked ghastly.
A passenger got in; he did not look quite so dazed as
some did, but savage and cross. For a time none spoke;
at last someone said aloud—I don’t think he expected
an answer—</p>

<p>“What on earth’s become of them?” and the cross looking
man, who got in last, growled out,</p>

<p>“That’s the worst of it; they are not <i>on earth</i>, they
are gone. My boy always said it would be so; from
the very first moment I heard it, I knew what had happened;
often he has warned me. I still have his voice
ringing in my ears.</p>

<p>“‘I tell you, in <i>that night</i> there shall be two men in
one bed: the one shall be taken, and the other shall be
left.’ (Luke xvii. 34.)</p>

<p>“I know only too well ‘<i>that night</i>’ was <i>last</i> night.
I’ve often prayed for it without thinking, and so I daresay
have you: ‘Thy kingdom come.’ It makes me so
savage I don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p>Now, I was an atheist, and did not believe the Bible.
For the last thirty years (I am past fifty) I had stuck
to my opinions, and when I heard men talk religious
trash I invariably objected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>But this seemed altogether different. I tell you, for
a thousand pounds I couldn’t have said a word. I just
hoped it would all turn out a dream, but the further we
went, the more certain it became that we were all awake,
and that by some unaccountable visitation of Providence
a number of people had suddenly disappeared in the night.</p>

<p>The whole of society was unhinged; everybody had
to do somebody’s else’s work. For instance, at the
terminus, a porter had been put into Smith’s stall, as the
usual man was missing. Cabs were not scarce, but some
of those who drove them seemed unlicensed and new
to their work. The shutters in some of the shops were
up, and on getting to my bank I heard the keys had
only just been found.</p>

<p>Everyone was silent, and afraid lest some great misfortune
was coming. I noticed we all seemed to mistrust
one another, and yet as each fresh clerk, turned up late,
entered the counting-room, a low whisper went round.
The chief cashier, as I expected, did not come. The
newspapers no one cared to look at; there seemed a
tacit opinion that <i>they</i> could tell us nothing.</p>

<p>Business was at a standstill. I saw that very soon.
I hoped as the day wore on that it would revive, but
it did not. The clerks went off without asking my
permission, and I was left alone. I felt I hated them.
I did not know what to do. I could not well leave,
else they might say the bank had stopped payment, and
yet I felt I could not stay there. Business seemed to
have lost its interest, and money its value. I put up the
shutters myself, and at once noticed what a change had
come over the City while I had been at the bank. <i>Then</i>
all were trying to fill the void places; <i>now</i> it seemed
as if the attempt had failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>In the City some of the streets had that dismal Sunday
appearance, while a few houses had been broken into;
but in the main thoroughfares there was a dense mass
of people, hurrying, it struck me, they knew not where.
Some seemed dazed, others almost mad with terror. At
the stations confusion reigned, and I heard there had
been some terrible accidents. I went into my club, but
the waiters had gone off without leave, and one had to
help oneself.</p>

<p>As evening came on, I saw the lurid reflection of
several fires, but, horrible to say, no one seemed to
mind, and I felt myself that if the whole of London
were burnt, and I with it, I should not care. For the
first time in my life I no longer feared Death: I rather
looked on him as a friend.</p>

<p>As the gas was not lit, and darkness came down
upon us, one heard cries and groans. I tried to light
the gas, but it was not turned on. I remembered there
was a taper in the writing-room. I went and lit it, but
of course it did not last long. I groped my way into
the dining-room, and helped myself to some wine, but I
could not find much, and what I took seemed to have
no effect; and when I heard voices, they fell on me
as if I were in a dream. They were talking of the
Bible, though, and it now seemed the one book worth
thinking of, yet in our vast club library I doubt if I should
have found a single copy.</p>

<p>One said: “What haunts me are the words ‘Watch
therefore.’ You can’t <i>watch</i> now.”</p>

<p>I thought of my dinner party. Little had I imagined
a week ago, when I issued the invitations, how I should
be passing the hour.</p>

<p>Suddenly I remembered the secretary had been a religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
fanatic, and I made my way slowly to his room,
knocking over a table, in my passage, with glasses on
it. It fell with a crash which sounded through the
house, but no one noticed it. By the aid of a match I
saw candles on his writing table and lit them. Yes! as
I thought, there was his Bible. It was open as if he
had been reading it when called away, and another book
I had never seen before lay alongside of it—a sort of
index.</p>

<p>The Bible was open at Proverbs, and these verses,
being marked, caught my eye:</p>

<p>“Because I have called and ye refused, I have stretched
out My hand and no man regarded; I also will laugh at
your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh.”</p>

<p>I had never thought before of God laughing—of God
mocking. I had fancied man alone did that. Man’s
laughing had ended now—I saw that pretty plain.</p>

<p>I had a hazy recollection of a verse that spoke of men
wanting the rocks to fall on them; so looked it up in the
index. Yes, there was the word “Rock,” and some of
the passages were marked with a pencil. One was Deut.
xxxii. 15: “He forsook God which made him, and lightly
esteemed the Rock of our Salvation.”</p>

<p>Perhaps he marked that passage after he had had a
talk with me. How well I remember the earnestness
with which he pressed salvation upon me that day—explaining
the simplicity of trusting Christ and His
blood for pardon—and assuring me that if I only
yielded myself to the Lord I should understand the
peace and joy he talked about. But it was no use. I
remember I only chaffed him, and said mockingly that
his God was a myth, and time would prove it, and he
answered,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>“Never. ‘Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
My Word shall not pass away.’ He may come to-night.”</p>

<p>I laughed and said, “What odds will you take? I lay
you long ones.”</p>

<p>Another passage marked was 1 Samuel ii. 2, “Neither
is there any rock like our God,” and lower still “Man
who built his house upon a rock.”</p>

<p>I had no need to look that out. I knew what it referred
to, and then my eye caught Matt. xxvii. 51, “The earth
did quake, and the rocks rent.” That was when Christ
died to save sinners, died to save me—and yet I had
striven against Him all my life. I could not bear to
read more. I shut the book and got up. There were
some texts hanging over the fireplace:</p>

<p>“Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins
may be blotted out.”—Acts iii. 19.</p>

<p>“The blood of Jesus Christ His son cleanseth us from
all sin.”—1 John i. 7.</p>

<p>“Now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of
salvation.”—2 Cor. vi. 2.</p>

<p>As I turned to leave the room these caught my eye,
and I said, “Well, I have been a fool.”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond looked up from the little booklet,—a
look of bewilderment was in his eyes, a sense of blankness,
almost of stupefaction, in his mind. Like one who,
half stunned, passes through some strange and wondrous
experience, and slowly recalls every item of that experience
as fuller consciousness returns, he went, mentally,
slowly over the story of the little book.</p>

<p>“The verisimilitude of the whole story is little less
than startling,” he murmured. His eyes dropped upon
the book again, and he read the last line aloud: “Well,
I have been a fool.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>Slowly, meditatively, he added: “And I, with every
other otherwise sane man who has been careless as to
whether such things are to be, am as big a fool as the
man in that book!”</p>

<p>He laid the dainty little messenger down on the table
by his bedside. His handling of the book was almost
reverential. Reaching to the electric lever, he switched
off the light. He wanted to think, and he could think
best in the dark.</p>

<p>“Of course, I know <i>historically</i>,” he mused, “all the
events of the Christ’s life, His death, His resurrection,
and—and——Well, <i>there</i>, I think, my knowledge ends.
In a vague way I have always known that the Bible said
something of a great final denouement to all the World
Drama—an award time of some kind, a millennium of
perfect—perfect—well perfect everything that is peaceful
and——Oh, I don’t know much about it, after all. I
am very much in a fog, I see, for Mrs. Joyce and that
booklet both speak of a return of Christ into the air,
whither certain dead and certain living are to be caught
up to be with Him and to begin an eternity of bliss.”</p>

<p>For a moment or two he tried to disentangle his many
thoughts; then, with a weary little sigh, he gave up the
task, murmuring: “<i>I</i> certainly am not ready for any
such event. If there is to be a hideous leaving behind
of the <i>un</i>ready, then I should be left to all that unknown
hideousness.”</p>

<p>A myriad thoughts crowded upon his brain. He gave
up, at length, the perplexing attempt to think out the
problem, telling himself that with the coming of the new
day he would begin a definite search for the real facts
of this great mystery—the second coming of Christ.</p>

<p>By an exercise of his will he finally settled himself
to sleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">“Will</span> you come into my workroom, Mr. Hammond?
It is a kind of sanctum to me as well
as a workroom, and I always feel that I can talk freer
there than anywhere else.”</p>

<p>It was the Jew, Abraham Cohen, who said these
words. His visitor was Tom Hammond. It was the
morning after that Tom Hammond had been troubled
about “Long Odds” and its mysterious subject.</p>

<p>Jew and Gentile had had a few moments’ general
talk in the sitting-room downstairs, but Cohen wanted
to see his visitor alone—to be where nothing should
interrupt their conversation.</p>

<p>Tom Hammond’s first vision of Cohen’s workroom
amazed him. As we have seen before, the apartment
was a large one, and, besides being a workroom, partook
of the character of a study, den, sanctum—anything of
that order that best pleases the reader.</p>

<p>But it was the finished work which chiefly arrested
the attention of Tom Hammond, and in wondering tones
he cried: “It is all so exquisitely wrought and fashioned!
But <i>what</i> can it be for?”</p>

<p>Cohen searched his visitor’s face with his deep grave
eyes.</p>

<p>“Will you give me your word, Mr. Hammond,” he
asked, “that you will hold in strictest confidence the
fact that this work is here in this place, if I tell you
what it is for?”</p>

<p>“I do give you my word of honour, Mr. Cohen.” As<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
he spoke, Tom Hammond held forth his hand. The Jew
grasped the hand, there was an exchange of grips; then,
as their clasp parted, the Jew said:</p>

<p>“I do not wish to bind you to any secrecy as to the
fact that such work as this is being performed in England,
but only that you should preserve the secret of
the whereabouts of the work and workers.” With a
sudden glow of pride—it flashed in his eyes, it rang in
his tones—he cried, “This work is for the New Temple!”</p>

<p>“The New Temple? I don’t think I quite understand
you, Mr. Cohen. Where is this temple being built?”
There was amaze in Tom Hammond’s voice.</p>

<p>“It is not yet begun,” replied the Jew. “That is, the
actual rearing has not yet begun, though the preparations
are well forward. The New Temple is to be at
Jerusalem, Mr. Hammond.”</p>

<p>The ring of pride deepened in his voice as he went
on: “There can be no other site for the Temple of
Jehovah save Zion, the city of our God, beautiful for
situation, the joy of the whole earth—the centre of the
world, Mr. Hammond.”</p>

<p>As he talked, Tom Hammond, watching him intently,
saw how the soul of the man and the hope of the true
Israelite shone out of his eyes.</p>

<p>Crossing the room to where a chart of the world
(on Mercator’s Projection) hung on the wall, the Jew
took an inch-marked straight-edge, and laying one end
of it on Barrow Point, Alaska, he marked the spot on the
straight-edge where it touched Jerusalem. From Jerusalem
to Wrangel Land, Siberia, farthest east, he showed
by his straight-edge that practically he got the same
measurement as when from the west. From Jerusalem
to North Cape, Scandinavia, and from Jerusalem to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
Cape of Good Hope, he showed again was each practically
the same distance.</p>

<p>“Always, always, is Zion the centre of the inhabited
earth!” he cried in quiet, excited tones. Moving quickly
back to Hammond’s side, he said: “Did you ever think
of this, sir, that, practically speaking, all the nations
west of Jerusalem (those of Europe) write from west
to east—that is, towards the city of our God; whilst all
the Asiatic races (those east of Zion) write from east
to west—just the opposite,—but always <i>towards</i> Zion?
No, no, sir; there can be no other place on earth for the
New Temple of Jehovah save Jerusalem. Read Ezekiel,
from the fortieth chapter, sir, and you will see how
glorious a Temple Jehovah is to have soon. ‘Show the
house to the people of Israel,’ God said in vision to His
prophet, ‘and let them build it after the sum, the pattern
which I show you.’ And that, sir, is what we are
doing.”</p>

<p>“Who are the <i>we</i> who are doing this?” Tom Hammond’s
face was as full of wonder as his voice. “Who,”
he continued, “makes the plans, gives the orders, finds
the funds?”</p>

<p>“Wealthy, patriotic men of our people, sir. We as a
race are learning that soon the Messiah will come, and
we are proving our belief by preparing for the House
of our God. Italian Jews all over Italy are carving the
richest marbles; wrought iron, wondrous works in metal,
gold and silver ornaments, cornices, chapiters, bells for
the high priest’s robes, and a myriad other things are
being prepared; so that the moment the last restriction
on our land—the land of our fathers, the land which
Jehovah gave unto our forefather Abraham, saying,
‘Your seed shall possess it’—is removed, we shall begin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
to ship the several prepared parts of the Temple to
Palestine, as the Gentiles term our land.”</p>

<p>A curious little smile flittered over his face as he
added,</p>

<p>“The very march of modern times in the East, Mr.
Hammond, is all helping to make the consummation of
our work more easy. The new railways laid from the
coast to Jerusalem are surely part of the providence of
our God. When Messiah comes, sir, we shall be waiting
ready for Him, I trust.”</p>

<p>“But do you not know,” Tom Hammond interrupted,
“that according to every record of history as well as
the New Testament, all Christendom has believed, for
all the ages since, that the Messiah came nearly two
thousand years ago?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Nazarene</i>?”</p>

<p>There was as much or more of pity than scorn in
the voice of the Jew as he uttered the word.</p>

<p>“How could <i>He</i> be the Messiah, sir?” he went on.
“Could any good thing come out of Nazareth? Besides,
<i>our Messiah</i> is to redeem Israel, to deliver them from
the hand of the oppressor, and to gather again into one
nation all our scattered race. No, no! a thousand times
No! The Nazarene could not be <i>our</i> Messiah!”</p>

<p>Turning quickly to Hammond, he asked, “Are <i>you</i> a
Christian, sir?”</p>

<p>For a moment Tom Hammond was startled by the
suddenness, the definiteness, of the question. He found
no immediate word of reply.</p>

<p>“You are a <i>Gentile</i>, of course, Mr. Hammond,” the
Jew went on; “but are you a Christian? For it is a
curious fact that I find very few Gentiles whom I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
met, even <i>professed</i> Christians, and fewer still who ever
pretend to live up to their profession.”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond recovered himself sufficiently to say:</p>

<p>“Yes, I am a Gentile, of course, and I <i>suppose</i> I am—er——”</p>

<p>It struck him, as he floundered in the second half
of his reply, as being very extraordinary that he should
find it difficult to state why he supposed he was a
Christian. While he hesitated the Jew went on:</p>

<p>“Why should you say you <i>suppose</i>, sir? Is there nothing
distinctive enough about the possession of Christianity
to give assurance of it to its possessor? I do not <i>suppose</i>
I am a <i>Jew</i>, sir (by religion I mean, and not merely
by race.) No, sir, I do not suppose, for I <i>know</i> it. There
is all the difference in the world, it seems to me, sir,
between the mere theology and the religion of the faith
we profess. The religion is life, it seems to me, sir;
theology is only the science of that life.”</p>

<p>Both men were so utterly absorbed in their talk that
they did not hear a touch on the handle of the door.
It was only as it opened that they turned round. Zillah
stood framed in the doorway. Cohen, who saw her
every day, realized that she had never looked so radiantly
beautiful before. She had almost burst into the room,
but paused as she saw that a stranger was present.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” she began; “I had no idea you had a
friend with you, Abraham.”</p>

<p>She would have retreated, but he stopped her with an
eager—</p>

<p>“Come in, Zillah.”</p>

<p>She advanced, gazing in curious inquiry at Hammond.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Tom Hammond, editor of the ‘Courier,’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
Zillah,” Cohen explained to the young girl. To Hammond
he added, “My wife’s sister, Zillah Robart.”</p>

<p>The introduced pair shook hands. The young Jew
went on to explain to Zillah how the great editor came
to be visiting him.</p>

<p>Tom Hammond’s eyes were fixed upon the vision of
loveliness that the Jewess made. She was going to
assist at the wedding of a girl-friend, and had come to
show herself to her brother-in-law before starting.
Lovely at the most ordinary times, she looked perfectly
radiant in her well-chosen wedding finery.</p>

<p>Tom Hammond had seen female loveliness in many
lands—East, North, West, South. He had gazed upon
women who seemed too lovely for earth—women whose
flesh was alabaster, whose glance would woo emperors;
women whose skins glowed with the olive of southern
lands, the glance of whose black, lustrous eyes intoxicated
the beholder in the first instant: Inez of Spain, Mousmee
of Japan, Katrina of Russia, Carlotta of Naples, Rosie
of Paris, Maggie of the Scottish Highlands, Patty of
Wales, Kate of Ireland, and a score of other typical
beauties. But this Jewish maiden, this Zillah of Finsbury—she
was beyond all his thought or knowledge of
feminine loveliness.</p>

<p>While Cohen talked on for a moment or two, and
Zillah’s eyes were fixed upon her brother-in-law, Tom
Hammond’s gaze was riveted upon the lovely girl.</p>

<p>Every feature of her beautiful face became photographed
on his brain. Had he been a clever artist, he
could have gone to his studio and have flung with burning,
brilliant haste her face upon his canvas.</p>

<p>He thought of Zenobia as he looked upon her brow.
He wondered if ever two such wide, black, lustrous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
eyes had ever shone in the face of a woman before, or
whether a female soul had ever before been mirrored in
such eyes.</p>

<p>Her mouth was not the large, wide feature so often
seen in women of her race, but of exquisite lines, with
ripe, full lips, as brilliant in colour as the most glowing
coral. Her eyes were fringed with the blackest, finest,
silkiest lashes. Her hair was raven in hue and wondrous
in its wealth.</p>

<p>He realized, in that first moment of full gazing upon
her, how faded every other female face must ever
seem beside her glorious beauty. With a strange freak
of mental conjuring, Madge Finisterre and that interrupted
tete-a-tete rose up before him, and a sudden sense
of relief swept over him that George Carlyon had
returned at the moment that he did.</p>

<p>“It is all so strange, so wonderful to me, what I
have seen and heard here,” he jerked out as Cohen
finished his explanation.</p>

<p>Hammond spoke to the beautiful girl, whose great
lustrous eyes had suddenly come back to his face.</p>

<p>For a moment or two longer he voiced his admiration
of the separate pieces of finished work, and spoke
of his own growing interest in the Jewish race.</p>

<p>The great black eyes that gazed upwards into his,
grew liquid with the evident emotion that filled the soul
of the beautiful girl. With the frank, hearty, simple
gesture of the perfectly unconventional woman, she
held forth her hand to Hammond as she said:</p>

<p>“It is so good of you, sir, to speak thus of my brother-in-law’s
work and of our race. There are few who
speak kindly of us. Even though, as a nation, you English
give our poor persecuted people sanctuary, yet there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
are few who care for us or speak kindly of us, and fewer
still who speak kindly to us.”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond held the pretty, plump little hand that
she offered him clasped warmly in his, almost forgetting
himself as he gazed down into her expressive face and
listened to her rich musical voice. There was an ardency
in his gaze that was unknown, unrealized, by himself.</p>

<p>The olive of the girl’s cheeks warmed under the power
of his gaze. He saw the warm colour rise, and remembered
himself, shifted his eyes, and released her hand.</p>

<p>“I must not stay another moment, Abraham,” she
cried, turning to the Jew. “Adah would be vexed if I
were late.”</p>

<p>She turned back to Hammond, but before she could
speak he was saying,</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Miss Robart; I hope we may meet again.
What your brother has already told me only incites me
to come again and see him, for there are many things
I want to know.”</p>

<p>He shook hands with the girl again. His eyes met
hers, and again he saw the olive cheeks suddenly warm.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he was driving back to his office,
his mind in a strange whirl, the beautiful face of Zillah
Robart filling all his vision.</p>

<p>He pulled himself up at last, and laughed low and
amusedly as he murmured,</p>

<p>“And I am the man whose pulses had never been
quickened by the sight or the touch of a woman until
I met her——”</p>

<p>The memory of Madge Finisterre flashed into his
mind. He smiled to himself as he mused:</p>

<p>“Even when I seemed most smitten by Madge, by her
piquant Americanism, I told myself I was not sure that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
love had anything to do with my feelings. Now I
know it had not.”</p>

<p>His eyes filled suddenly with a kind of staring wonder
as he cried out, in a low, startled undertone:</p>

<p>“Am I inferring to myself that this sudden admiration
for Zillah Robart has any element of love in it?”</p>

<p>He smiled at his own unuttered answer. The cab
pulled up at the door of the office at that moment. He
came back sharply to everyday things.</p>

<span class="smaller">A DEMON.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Madge Finisterre</span> awoke early on the morning
after that discussion with herself anent Hammond’s
possible proposal.</p>

<p>With startling suddenness, as she lay still a moment,
a vision of the pastor of Balhang came up before her
mind. Then a strange thing happened to her, for a
yearning sense of home-sickness suddenly filled her.</p>

<p>She tried to laugh at herself for her “childishness,” as
she called it, and sprang from her bed to prepare for
her bath. Standing for one instant by the bedside, she
murmured:</p>

<p>“But, after all, it is time I was paddling across again.
Who ever heard of anyone from our side staying here
through the winter? I must think this all out seriously.
Anyway, I’ll get my bath, and dress, and go for a stroll
before breakfast. They say that one ought to see suburban
London pouring over the bridges into London city
in the early morning. I’ll go this morning.”</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later she was dressed ready for her
expedition. As she passed the office on her way out,
they were sorting the morning mail. She waited for
her letters. There was only one, but it was from home.</p>

<p>Racing back to her room, she tore it open with an
eagerness born, unconsciously to herself, of the nostalgia
that had seized upon her three-quarters of an hour before.</p>

<p>There were two large, closely-written sheets in the
letter—one from her father and one from her mother.
Each told their own news.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>She read her father’s first; every item interested her,
though as she read she seemed to feel that there was
all through it an underlying strain of longing for her
return.</p>

<p>“Dear old poppa!” she murmured as she neared the
finish of the epistle.</p>

<p>Suddenly her eyes took in the two lines of postscript
jammed close into the bottom edge of the first sheet.
Her heart seemed to stand still as she read:—</p>

<p>“Pastor is considered sick. Doctor can’t make his
case out.”</p>

<p>“Pastor sick!” She gasped the words aloud; then,
turning swiftly to her mother’s letter, she cried:
“Momma will tell more than this!”</p>

<p>Her eyes raced over the written lines. Her mother
said a little more than her father had done about the
sickness of their friend and pastor; not much, though,
in actual words, but to the disturbed heart of the young
girl there seemed to her much deeper meaning.</p>

<p>An excited trembling came upon her for a few
moments. The next instant she had put a strong curb
upon herself, and, folding the letters, and replacing them
in the envelope, she cried out quietly, but sharply:</p>

<p>“The boat from Southampton sails at two to-day. I’ll
catch that!”</p>

<p>The next instant she was divesting herself of her
hat and jacket, and began to set about her packing.</p>

<p>Now and again she talked to herself thus: “Sick,
is he? Poor old pastor! I guess I know what’s the
matter with him, and I’ll put him right in five minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>She smiled as she went on: “I guess, too, I’ve found
out what’s the matter with me—I want to be a pastor’s
wife!”</p>

<p>The next instant her voice was carolling out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For I tell them they need not come wooing of me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For my heart, my heart, is over the sea.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Her fingers were busy, her mind all the time kept
mentally arranging a host of things.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” she murmured presently, “how Uncle
Archibald and George will take my sudden departure?
Well, I’m glad George is out of town. He’s been showing
signs of spoons lately with me, so it’s best, perhaps,
that I should get off without seeing him.”</p>

<p class="tb">By eleven that forenoon she had left Waterloo. Her
uncle had seen her off from the station. He wanted to
accompany her to Southampton, but she would not hear
of it.</p>

<p>“I want to be very quiet all the way down,” she said,
“and write some important letters. Make my excuses
to everybody, and explain that I only had an hour or
two to do everything.”</p>

<p>At the last moment her uncle slipped an envelope into
her hand, saying, “You are not to open it until you have
been travelling a quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p>Then came the good-byes, and—off.</p>

<p>She had been travelling <i>nearly</i> a quarter of an hour
when she opened the envelope. There was a brief,
hearty, loving note inside, in her uncle’s hand-writing,
expressing the joy her visit had given him, and his sense
of loneliness at her going, and saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Please, dear Madge, accept the enclosure in second
envelope, as a souvenir of your visit, from your affectionate</p>

<p>She opened the smaller envelope. To her breathless
amazement, she found a Bank of England note for
£1,000. When she recovered herself a little, a smile
filled her eyes as she murmured:</p>

<p>“Fancy an American Methodist pastor’s wife with a
thousand pounds of her own! My!”</p>

<p>The train was rushing on; she remembered that she
had a special letter to write. She opened her bag and
took out writing materials. The carriage rocked tremendously,
but she managed to pen her letter. Before
she finally enclosed the letter in an envelope, she took
from her purse a two-inch cutting from the columns of
some newspaper or magazine. This she placed in the
letter.</p>

<p class="tb">Tom Hammond had just settled himself down to
work when a letter, bearing the Southampton post-mark,
was delivered to him. Opening it, and reading “My
dear Mr. Hammond,” he turned next to the signature.
“Madge Finisterre?” he cried softly, surprisedly, under
his breath. Wonderingly he turned back to the first
page, and read:</p>

<p>“You will be surprised to know that when you receive
this I shall be steaming down Channel <i>en route</i> for
New York. I got letters from home this morning that
made it imperative that I should start at once.</p>

<p>“I cannot leave without thanking you for all your
kindness to me. It has been a pleasure to have known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
you, and I sincerely hope that we may meet again
some day.</p>

<p>“Now I am going to take you right into my confidence,
Mr. Hammond, for who so discreet as a ‘prophet?’—vide
‘The Courier.’</p>

<p>“Yesterday evening, after dinner, I had a long talk
alone with myself. I had had a very pleasant tete-a-tete
tea with a friend—perhaps you may remember this,—and
while I went over in mind many things in connection
with that tete-a-tete, especially the events immediately
preceding the interruption, I suddenly realized a
sense of longing for home.</p>

<p>“A night or two before I sailed from America, our
pastor asked me to be his wife. He was awfully in
earnest, poor fellow; and I could see how love for me—gay,
frivolous little me—was consuming him. I was
startled at the proposition, and told him frankly that
I did not know my own mind, but that if ever I found
out that I loved him, I would come right away and tell
him so. I found out this morning, when I heard that
he was dangerously sick, that I wanted him as much
as ever he wanted me. At this stage of the letter, please
read the cutting enclosed.”</p>

<p>Wondering what the clipping could have to do with
the subject, Tom Hammond laid down the letter and
read the cutting:</p>

<p>“A king had a son born to him in his old age, and
was warned by his astrologers and physicians, that his
son would be blind if he ever saw the light before he
was twelve years old. Accordingly the king built for
him a subterranean chamber, where he was kept till he
was past the fatal age. Thereupon he was taken out
from his retreat, and shown all the beauties of the world,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
gold and jewels and arms, and carriages and horses, and
beautiful dresses. But seeing some women pass, he
asked what they might be, and was told, ‘Demons, who
lead men astray.’ Afterwards the king asked him which
of all the beautiful things he had seen he desired most,
and the prince answered, ‘The demons which lead men
astray.’</p>

<p>“I am going back to be demon to my pastor,” the
letter went on, “to lead him—not astray, I trust, but
back to health. Please keep all this in absolute confidence,
for I have not given even a hint of it to my uncle.
Whenever you visit the States, be sure to come and visit
me, for no one will be more welcome from the Old Country
than yourself.</p>

<p>“By-the-bye, dear friend, apropos of your remark
anent the presence of a woman to make tea for you,
keep the subject well before yourself, and when you
see the lady who can really satisfy all your ideals, propose
quickly, secure her, and—happy thought—do America
by way of a honey-moon, and come and see me.</p>

<p class="center">
“Yours most sincerely,<br />
</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Madge Finisterre</span>.”<br />
</p>

<p>He smiled as he laid down the letter. For a moment
all the bright, piquant personality of the writer filled
his vision. Then, with a swiftness and completeness that
was almost startling, her face vanished from his mental
picturing, and Zillah Robart, in all her radiant loveliness,
took the place in his thought and vision.</p>

<p>For a brief while he was absorbed in his new vision.
The sudden entrance of Ralph Bastin dispelled his
dreaming.</p>

<p>After a few moments’ talk, Bastin cried, quite excitedly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
“I say, Tom, those pars of yours about the Jews
are the talk of all London—our London, I mean, of
course.”</p>

<p>Without breaking the confidence reposed in him by
Cohen, Tom Hammond told his friend what he had
recently discovered as to the Jewish work on the materials
for the New Temple.</p>

<p>“That’s strange, Tom,” returned Bastin. “I dropped
in now as much as anything to tell you that last night
I met Dolly Anstruther—you remember her, don’t you?—the
little Yorkshire girl that was learning sculpture
when we were staying at Paris with Montmarte.</p>

<p>“She has just come back from Italy, where she has
been three years. She told me how startled she was
to hear from several sources about this New Temple
business. She said she visited a very large studio in
Milan, and saw the most magnificent pillar she had
ever seen. She asked the great artist what it was for,
and he said, ‘It is a pillar for the New Temple at
Jerusalem.’</p>

<p>“In Rome she visited another great studio, and there
she saw a duplicate of the Milan pillar, and was told
again, ‘Oh, that is a pillar for the future Temple at
Jerusalem.’</p>

<p>“In another place, where the most wonderful brass-work
in the world is turned out, she saw two magnificent
gates; and, on inquiring where they were destined
to be hung, received the same reply, ‘In the future
Temple at Jerusalem.’ What does it all mean, Tom?”
he added.</p>

<p>“That is what I want to find out, to be perfectly
sure of, Ralph. My intelligent Jew, of whom I told
you, declares that the Messiah is coming. We, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Christians—nominal Christians, I mean, of course,—same as
you and I, Ralph, don’t profess anything more——”</p>

<p>Bastin searched his friend’s face with a sudden keenness,
but did not interrupt him by asking him what he
meant.</p>

<p>“As nominal Christians,” Tom Hammond went on,
“we believe the Christ has already come. But the question
has been aroused in my mind of late (suggested by
certain things that I have not time to go into now),
does the Bible teach that Christ is coming again, and are
all these strange movings among the Jews and in the
politics of the world so many signs and——”</p>

<p>There came an interruption at that moment. The tape
was telling of the assassination of a Continental crowned
head. Both men became journalists, pure and simple, in
an instant.</p>

<span class="smaller">MAJOR H—— ON “THE COMING!”</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Tom Hammond</span> was riding westwards in the
Tube. It was the morning after the events narrated
in the last chapter. He had just bought from a
book-stall a volume of extracts from essays on art in
all its branches. He sat back in the comfortable seat of
the car dipping into the book. Suddenly an extract
arrested his attention.</p>

<p>It was evidently a description of the Crucifixion, but—most
tantalizing—the head of this page was torn, he
could find out nothing about the authorship. But the
extract interested him:—</p>

<p>“Darkness—sooty, portentous darkness—shrouds the
whole scene; only above the accursed wood, as if through
a horrid rift in the murky ceiling, a rainy deluge—‘sleety-flaw,
discoloured water’—streams down amain, spreading
a grisly, spectral light, even more horrible than
that palpable night. Already the Earth pants thick
and fast! The darkened Cross trembles! The winds
are dropt—the air is stagnant—a muttering rumble
growls underneath their feet, and some of the miserable
crowd begin to fly down the hill. The horses sniff the
coming terror, and become unmanageable through fear.
The moment rapidly approaches, when, nearly torn
asunder by His own weight, fainting with loss of blood,
which now runs in narrower rivulets from His slit veins,
His temples and breast drowned in sweat, and His black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
tongue parched with the fiery death-fever, Jesus cried,
‘I thirst.’ The deadly vinegar is elevated to Him.</p>

<p>“His head sinks, and the sacred corpse ‘swings senseless
on the cross.’ A sheet of vermilion flame shoots
sheer through the air and vanishes; the rocks of Carmel
and Lebanon cleave asunder; the sea rolls on high from
the sands its black, weltering waves. Earth yawns, and
the graves give up their dwellers. The dead and the
living are mingled together in unnatural conjunction, and
hurry through the Holy City.</p>

<p>“New prodigies await them there. The veil of the
Temple—the unpierceable veil—is rent asunder from top
to bottom, and that dreaded recess, containing the
Hebrew mysteries—the fatal ark, with the tables and
seven-branched candelabrum—is disclosed by the light of
unearthly flames to the God-deserted multitude.”</p>

<p>“Strange!” he mused, as his eyes stared into space, his
mind occupied with the thought of the extract. “Strange
how everything of late seems to be compelling my attention
to the Christ—Christ past, Christ future.”</p>

<p>At that instant he heard someone mention the name
of his paper. He glanced in the direction of the voices.
Two gentlemen were talking together. It was evident
that his own identity was utterly unknown to them.</p>

<p>“You’re right, you’re right,” the second man was saying.
“A very clever fellow, evidently, that editor of the
<i>Courier</i>.”</p>

<p>“You have noticed, of course,” the first man went on,
“those striking paragraphs, of late, about the Jews.
Though, to a keen student of the subject, they show
a very superficial knowledge; still, it is refreshing to
find a modern newspaper editor writing like that at all.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the other said, “but it is strange how few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
people, even Christian people, ever realize how intimately
the future of the Jewish race is bound up with
that other shamefully neglected truth—the coming of
the Lord for His Church. I wish the editor of the
<i>Courier</i>, and every other newspaper editor, could be
induced to go this afternoon and hear Major H——
speak on these things at the —— Room.”</p>

<p>“British Museum!” called the conductor of the car.
The two talkers got out. Tom Hammond also alighted.
As he mounted in the lift to the street, he decided that
he would hear this major on the subject that was occupying
his own perplexed thought so much.</p>

<p>Three o’clock that afternoon found him one of a congregation
of three to four hundred persons in the ——
Room. He was amazed at the quality of the audience.
He recognized quite a dozen well-known London clergymen
and ministers, with a score of other equally well-known
laymen—literary men, merchants, etc. All were
of a superior class. There was a large sprinkling of
ladies, who, in many cases, were evidently sisters. Unaccustomed
to such meetings, Tom Hammond did not
know how enormous is the number of Christian women
who are to be found at special religious gatherings,
conventions, etc.</p>

<p>There was a subdued hum of whispering voices in
the place. The hum suddenly ceased. Tom Hammond
glanced quickly towards the platform. Half-a-dozen
gentlemen and one or two ladies were taking their seats
there. They bowed their heads in silent prayer.</p>

<p>A minute later a tall, fine looking man, the centre
one of the platform group, rose to his feet and advanced
to the rail. He held a hymn-book in his hand. His
keen eyes swept the faces of the gathered people. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
in a clear, ringing voice like the voice of a military officer
on the battle-field, he cried:</p>

<p>“Number three-twenty-four. Let every voice ring out
in song.”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond opened the linen-covered book that
had been handed to him as he entered, and was almost
startled to note the likeness of the sentiment of the
hymn to the poem of B. M., which had struck him
so forcibly that night in his office.</p>

<p>The major gave out the first verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When sunlight thro’ darkness and shadow is breaking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Jesus will come in the fulness of glory,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">To take out of the world ‘His own.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The major paused a moment to interpolate, “Let the
gladness of the thought ring out in your voices as you
sing, but especially in the chorus.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“O Lord Jesus, how long?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How long ere we shout the glad song</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Christ returneth! Hallelujah!</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Hallelujah! Amen!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The singing of that hymn was a revelation to Tom
Hammond. He had heard hearty, ringing, triumphant
song at Handel festivals, etc., but among the rank and
file, so to speak, of Christians he had never heard anything
like the singing of that verse and chorus.</p>

<p>A hundred thoughts and conflicting emotions filled
him as he realized, as the hymn went on, that these
people were really inspired by the glorious hope of the
return of the Christ. Once he shuddered as the thought
presented itself to his mind,</p>

<p>“How should <i>I</i> fare if this Christ came suddenly—came
now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>Twice over the last verse was sung, the quiet rapture
of the singers being doubly accentuated as the glorious
words rang out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, joy! oh, delight! should we go without dying!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">When Jesus receives ‘His own.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With the last-sung note the voice of the Major rang
out again:</p>

<p>“General Sir R. P.—— will lead us in prayer.”</p>

<p>The hush that followed was of the tensest. It lasted
a full half-minute, then the old general’s voice led in
a prayer such as Tom Hammond had never even conceived
possible to human lips, and such as, certainly, he
had never heard before. It awed him, and at the same
time revealed to him that real Christianity was something
which he, with all his knowledge of men and
things, had never before come in contact with.</p>

<p>The prayer concluded, not a moment was wasted.
In his clear, ringing tones, the major began:</p>

<p>“Turn with me, if you will, dear friends, to the first
chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, and the eleventh
verse.”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond wished that he had a Bible with him.
It seemed to him that he was the only person there
without one. In an instant every Bible was opened at
the passage named. There was no searching, no fumbling.
This was another revelation to him.</p>

<p>“They know their Bibles,” he mused, “better than I
do my dictionary or encyclopædia.”</p>

<p>But his attention was suddenly riveted on the major,
who, pocket Bible in hand, was saying;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>“Suffer me, friends, to change one word in my reading,
that the truth may come home clearer to our hearts.
‘Ye men of London, ... This same Jesus which is taken
up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner
as ye have seen Him go into heaven.’”</p>

<p>He paused for one instant, then went on: “The second
coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is, I
believe, the central truth of real, true Christianity at
this moment, and it should be carefully, diligently studied
by every converted soul. It should be comprehended
as far as Scripture reveals it, and so apprehended that
we should live in daily, hourly expectancy of that return.
Moody, the great evangelist, to whom the whole subject
(as he tells us) was once most objectionable, upon
studying the Word of God for himself, in this connection,
was so profoundly impressed with the insistence with
which the return of the Lord was emphasized, that he
was compelled to believe in it, and to preach it, saying,
‘It is almost the most precious truth of all the Bible.
Why, one verse in thirteen throughout the New Testament
is said to allude to this wondrous subject in some
form or another.’</p>

<p>“Many of you who are present this afternoon are not
only conversant with this glorious matter, but are living
in the glad expectancy of the return of your Lord. But
there are sure to be some here to-day to whom the
whole subject is foreign, and to you—even if there be
only one such—I shall speak as plainly, frankly, simply,
yearningly, as though we were tete-a-tete.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ADDRESS.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">“Now</span> to begin. Even in the Church of God there
are whole multitudes to whom the very title of
this afternoon’s address is but jargon. They will not
search the Word for it, they will barely tolerate its
mention. Why? ‘Oh,’ say some, ‘hidden things are not
to be searched into.’ Others there are who spiritualize
every reference to the Lord’s second coming, and say,
‘Yes, of course, He has come again, He has come into
my heart, or how else could I have become a child
of God.’</p>

<p>“To these last, these dreamers, we would respectfully
say, ‘A coming into the air for His people, to take them
up, is a totally different thing to coming into the heart
to indwell as Saviour and Keeper while we are travelling
life’s pathway.’</p>

<p>“There is another section of the Christian Church
who say, ‘We do not want to hear anything about it.
Our minister don’t hold with it; it is not a doctrine of
our church.’ Now, such an argument as this is blasphemous,
since, if God has put it into His Word, it is blasphemy
to ignore it, to refuse to believe it.</p>

<p>“Two distinct advents are plainly taught in Scripture.
The first, of Jesus’ birth as a Babe in Bethlehem,
the second as ‘Son of Man’—glorified, who shall come
in the clouds. Now, every Christian will admit, nay,
more, the very worldling admits the fact that every
Scripture relating to the first advent, as to time, place,
circumstances, was literally fulfilled, even to the minutest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
detail. Then, in the name of common-sense, with the
same covenant Scriptures in our hands, why should we
not expect to see the predictions relating to the second
advent also fulfilled to the very letter?</p>

<p>“We have our Lord’s own definite promise in John
fourteen: ‘If I go, I will come again and receive you
unto Myself.’ We are all agreed that He went. Well,
in the same breath He said, ‘I will come again.’ Can
any English be plainer—‘And receive you unto Myself?’
That promise cannot allude to conversion, and it certainly
cannot allude to death, for death is a going to Him—if
we are saved.</p>

<p>“This expectancy of Christ’s return for His people
was the only hope of the early Church; and over and
over again, in a variety of ways in the epistles it is
shown to be the only hope of the Church, until that
Church is taken out of the world, as a bride is taken by
the bridegroom from her old home, to dwell henceforth
in his. There never has been any comfort to bereaved
ones in the thought of death, nor to any one of us who
are living is there any comfort in the contemplation of
death, save and except, of course, the thought of relief
from weariness and suffering, and in being translated to
a painless sphere, to be with Christ. But in the contemplation
of the coming of Christ, when the dead in
Christ shall rise, and those who are in Christ, who are
still living when He comes, there is the certainty of the
gladdest meeting when all are ‘caught up together in
the air, to be for ever with the Lord.’ No waiting until
the end of the world but, if He came this afternoon—and
this may happen—you who have loved ones with
Christ would that very instant meet them in the air,
with your Lord.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>Tom Hammond listened intently to every word of the
major’s, and, as Scripture after Scripture was referred
to, he saw how the speaker’s statements were all verified
by the Word of God.</p>

<p>“There are two points I would emphasize here,” the
major went on. “First, that we must not confuse the
second coming of the Lord—the coming in the air—for
His saints, with that later coming, probably seven
years after, when He shall come with His saints to reign.</p>

<p>“And, secondly, to those to whom this whole subject
may be new, I would say, you must not confuse the
second coming of our Lord with the end of the world.
The uninstructed, inexperienced child of God feels a
quaking of heart at all talk of such a coming.</p>

<p>“Such people shrink from the suddenness of it. They
say that there is no preparatory sign to warn us of that
coming. But that is not true.</p>

<p>“The Word of God gives many instructions as to
the signs of Christ’s near return, and the hour we live
in shows us these signs on every hand, so that it is only
those who are ignorant of the Word of God, or those
who are carelessly or wilfully blind to the signs around
(and this applies, we grieve to say, as much to ministers
as to people,) who fail to see how near must be the
moment of our Lord’s return.</p>

<p>“The first sign of this return is an awakening of
national life among the Jews, that shall immediately
precede their return—in unbelief—to their own land.
Please turn with me to Matthew twenty-four.”</p>

<p>There was again that soft rustle of turning leaves
that had struck Tom Hammond as so remarkable.
Someone behind him, at the same instant, passed a Bible,
open at the reference, to him over his shoulder. With a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
grateful glance and a murmured word of thanks, he
accepted the loan of the book.</p>

<p>“I will read a verse or two here and there,” the major
announced. “You who know your Bibles, friends, will
readily recall the subject-matter of the previous chapter,
and how our Lord after His terrible prediction upon
Jerusalem, added, ‘Behold, your house is left unto you
desolate. For I say unto you, Ye shall not see Me
henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh
in the name of the Lord.’</p>

<p>“This is Jewish, of course, but the whole matter of
the future of the Jews and of the return of the Lord
for His Church, and, later on, with His Church, are
bound up together. Presently, after uttering His last
prediction, the disciples came to Him privately, saying,</p>

<p>“‘Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall
be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the
world?”</p>

<p>“Keep your Bibles open where you now have them,
friends, and note this—that the two-fold answer of
our Lord’s is in the reverse order to the disciples’ question.
In verses four and five He points out what should
not be the sign of His coming. While, in verse six, He
shows what should not be the sign of the end of the
world. With these distinctions I shall have more to say
another day.</p>

<p>“This afternoon I want to keep close to the signs
of the coming of the Lord. Read then the thirty-second
and third verses: ‘Now learn a parable of the fig-tree:
when its branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves,
ye know that summer is nigh: so likewise ye, when ye
shall see all these things, know that’—look in the margins
of your Bible, please, and note that the ‘it’ of the text<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
becomes ‘He,’ which is certainly the only wise translation—‘when
ye shall see all these things, know that He
is near, even at your doors.’</p>

<p>“Now, I hardly need remind the bulk of you, friends,
gathered here this afternoon, that the fig-tree, in the
Gospels, represents Israel. The Bible uses three trees
to represent Israel at different periods of her history,
and in different aspects of her responsibility.</p>

<p>“The Old Testament uses the vine as the symbol of
Israel, the Gospels the fig, and the Epistles the olive.
At your leisure, friends, if you have never studied this,
do so. You will not be puzzled much over the blasting
of the barren fig-tree when you have made a study of
the whole of this subject, because you will see that it
was parabolic of God’s judgment on the unfruitful Jewish
race.</p>

<p>“Now, with this key of interpretation before us, how
pointed becomes this first sign of the return of our Lord.
‘When,’ He says, ‘the fig-tree putteth forth her leaves’—when
the Jewish nation shows signs of a revival of
national life and vitality,—‘then know that the coming of
the Lord draweth nigh.’</p>

<p>“The careful reader of the daily press, even though
not a Christian, ought to have long ago been awakened
to the startling fact that, after thousands of years, the
national life of Israel is awakening. The Jew is returning
to his own land—Palestine.</p>

<p>“Only a year or two ago the world was electrified by
hearing of the formation of that wonderful Zionist
movement. How it has spread and grown! And how,
ever since, the increasing thousands have been flocking
back to Palestine! There are now nearly three times the
number of Jews in and around Jerusalem, that there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
were after the return from the Babylonish captivity.
Agricultural settlements are extending all over the land.
Vineyards and olive-grounds are springing up everywhere.</p>

<p>“Now note a remarkable fulfillment of prophecy. Turn
to Isaiah xvii. 10, 11: ‘Therefore shalt thou plant pleasant
plants, and shalt set it with strange slips. In the
day thou shalt make thy plant to grow, and in the morning
shalt thou make thy seed to flourish; but the harvest
shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate
sorrow.’</p>

<p>“In the early months of eighteen-ninety-four the Jews
ordered two million vine-slips from America, which they
planted in Palestine. There is the fulfillment of the first
part of that prophecy, and if we are justified in believing,
as we think we are, that the return of the Lord is
imminent, then, as the tribulation will doubtless immediately
follow that return, and of the taking out of the
Church from the world, then the great gathering in of
the harvest of those vines will be in ‘the day of grief and
of desperate sorrow.’</p>

<p>“Now, let me read to you, friends, an extract from
the testimony of an expert, long resident in Palestine:</p>

<p>“‘There is not the shadow of a doubt,’ he writes,
‘as to the entire changing of the climate of the land
here (Palestine). The former and latter rains are becoming
the regular order of the seasons, and this is doubtless
due (physically, I mean) to the fact that the new
colonists are planting trees everywhere where they settle.
The land, for thousands of years, has been denuded of
trees, so that there was nothing to attract the clouds, etc.</p>

<p>“‘Comparing the rainfall for the last five years, I
find that there has been about as much rain in April as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
in March; whereas, comparing five earlier years, from
1880-85, I find that the rainfall in April was considerably
less than in March, and if we go back farther still,
we find that rain in April was almost unknown.</p>

<p>“‘Thus God is preparing the land for the people. The
people, too, are being prepared for the land. The day
is fast approaching when ‘the Lord will arise and have
mercy upon Zion.’</p>

<p>“I need hardly, I think, tell you what even the secular
press has been giving some most striking articles about
quite recently,—namely, the quiet preparation on the
part of the Jews of everything for the rebuilding of the
temple at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>“I see, by the lighting up of your faces, that you
are familiar with the fact that gates, pillars, marbles,
ornaments, and all else requisite for the immediate building
of the new temple are practically complete, and only
await the evacuation of the hideous Mohamedan, with all
his abominations, from Jerusalem, to be hurried to the
site of the old temple, and to be reared, a new temple
to Jehovah, by the Jew. Any day, Turkey—‘the sick
man of the East’—in desperate straits for money, may
sell Palestine to the Jews.</p>

<p>“The Jews are to return to their land in unbelief of
Christ being the Messiah. They will build their temple,
reorganize the old elaborate services, the lamb will be
slain again ‘between the two evenings,’ and—but all else
of this time belongs to another address. What we have
to see this afternoon is that the fig-tree—the Jewish
nation—is budding, and to hear Jesus Christ saying to
us, ‘When ye see all these things, know that He is near,
even at the doors.’</p>

<p>“Another sign of the return of our Lord is to be the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
world-wide preaching of the Gospel. Now, in this connection,
let me give a word of correction of a common
error on this point.</p>

<p>“The Bible nowhere gives a hint that the world is to
be converted before the return of the Lord for His
Church. As a matter of fact, the world—the times—are
to grow worse and worse; more polished, more cultured,
cleverer, better educated, yet grosser in soul, falser in
worship. The bulk of the Church shall have the form
of godliness, but deny the power.</p>

<p>“Men shall be ‘lovers of their own selves’—who can
deny that selfishness is not a crowning sin of this age?—‘covetous’—look
at the heaping up of riches, at the
cost of the peace, the honour, the very blood of others,—‘incontinent’—the
increase in our divorce court cases
is alarming, disgusting,—‘lovers of pleasure’—the whole
nation has run mad on pleasures.</p>

<p>“I need not enlarge further on this side of the subject,
save to repeat that the Word of God is most plain
and emphatic on this point, that the return of our Lord
is to be marked by a fearful declension from vital godliness.
But, with all this, there is to be a world-wide
proclamation of the truth of salvation in Jesus. Not
necessarily that every individual soul shall hear it, but
that all nations, etc., shall have it preached to them.</p>

<p>“Now, in this connection, let me mention a fact that
has deeply impressed me. It is this, that the greatest
reawakening in the hearts of individual Christians in all
the churches—England, America, the Colonies—as testified
to by all concerned, agrees, in time, with the awakening
of the Church of Christ to the special need of intercession
for foreign missions—namely, from 1873-75.</p>

<p>“I must close for this afternoon, lest I weary you.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
We will, God willing, come together again here on
Tuesday at the same hour, and I pray you all to be
much in prayer for blessing on the attempt to open up
these wondrous truths, and pray also that the right
kind of people may be gathered in. Will you all work
for this, as well as pray for it? Invite people to the
meetings.</p>

<p>“Do either of you know any editors of a daily paper?
If so, write to such, draw attention to these expositions,
urge your editors to come. Oh, if only we could
capture the daily press! What an extended pulpit, what
a far-reaching voice would our subject immediately
possess!</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know how far I ought to go on this line,
but even as I speak, it comes to me to ask you if any
one here present is acquainted with the evidently-gifted,
open-minded editor of ‘The Courier.’ We have all, of
course, been struck by his own utterances from the
‘Prophet’s Chamber’ column. Oh that he could be captured
for Christ; then his paper would doubtless be a
clarion for his Lord!”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond turned hot and cold. He trusted
that no one had recognized him. He would be glad to
get away unrecognized. Yet he was not offended by
the speaker’s personal allusion to him. He felt that the
major’s soul rang true.</p>

<p>“Before I close,” the major went on, “suffer me to
read an extract from the ‘Gentleman’s Magazine,’ of
the year seventeen hundred and fifty-nine:</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Urban,—Reading over chapter eleven, verse
two, of Revelation, a thought came to me that I had hit
upon the meaning of it which I desire you’ll publish in
one of your future magazines. The verse runs thus:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
“But the court which is without the temple leave out, and
measure it not, for it is given to the Gentiles, and the
holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two
months.”</p>

<p>“‘Now, according to the Scriptural way of putting a
day for a year, if we multiply forty-two months by
thirty (the number of days contained in a Jewish month,)
we have the time the Turks will reign over the Jews’
country, and the city of Jerusalem—viz., 1,260; which,
if we add to the year of our Lord 636, when Jerusalem
was taken by the Turks, we have the year of our Lord
1896, near or about which time the Jews will be reinstated
in their own country and city, Jerusalem, again,
which will be about 137 years hence; and that the Turks
are the Gentiles mentioned in the above-quoted chapter
and verse appears from their having that country and
city in possession about 1,123 years, and will continue
to possess it till the Omnipotent God, in His own time,
bringeth this prophecy to its full period.’</p>

<p>“This letter is signed ‘M. Forster,’ and is dated from
‘Bessborough, October 24th, 1759.’ I have very little
sympathy with those of our brethren who are ever venting
in speech and in print the exact dates (as they
declare) of the coming events surrounding the return of
our Lord, but I do believe (in spite of the somewhat
hazy chronology at our command) that the regarding
of approximate times is perfectly permissible, and the
letter I have read you has some value when, taking dates,
etc., approximately, we remember that this letter was
written nearly a hundred and fifty years ago, and that
1896 was memorable for a distinct movement towards
the Holy Land.</p>

<p>“So, I say, ‘the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
To myself and to every Christian here, I would say,
‘May God help us to quicken all our hearts, and purify
all our lives, that we may not be ashamed at His coming.’</p>

<p>“And to any who are here (if such there be) who
are not converted, may God help you to seek His face,
that you may not be ‘left,’ when He shall suddenly,
silently snatch away His Church out of this godless
generation. ‘Left!’</p>

<p>“Think of what that will mean, unsaved friend, if
you are here to-day. Left! Left behind! When the
Spirit of God will have been taken out of the earth.
When Satan will dwell on the earth—for, with the
coming of Christ into the air, Satan, ‘the prince of the
power of the air,’ will have to descend.</p>

<p>“Christ and Satan can never live in the same realm.
Oh, God, save anyone here from being left—left behind,
to come upon the unspeakable judgments which will
follow the taking out of the world of the Church!</p>

like the deep surge of a sea billow on a

<p>“Our time has gone, friends,” cried the major. “We
will sing two verses only of the closing hymn 410, the

<p>Tom Hammond, wondered at it all much as ever, listened
while the song rang out:</p>

<p>Again the chorus rang out, and as Tom Hammond

it clamoured to be hearkened to.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">HER CABIN COMPANION.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">“There’ll</span> be one other lady with you in your cabin,
miss.”</p>

<p>The berth-steward’s announcement in no way disconcerted
Madge Finisterre. She had had two cabin companions
on the outward voyage.</p>

<p>She was arranging her cabin necessaries when her
fellow-traveller entered. She was a wee, winsome girl,
very fragile in appearance, with a yearning sweetness
in her great grey eyes, such as Madge had never seen
in any eyes before. With half-a-dozen words of
exchanged greeting and a very warm handshake, the
pair became instant friends.</p>

<p>By a strange but happy coincidence neither of them
ever suffered from sea-sickness, and from the first
moment of the great liner’s departure they became
inseparable.</p>

<p>As the vessel forged her way down Channel that evening,
a glorious moon shining down upon them, the two
girls, arm-in-arm, paced the promenade deck talking.
The subject of the acute distress among the poor and
out-of-works in all the world’s great cities came up
between them.</p>

<p>“Oh, if only our Lord would come quickly!” cried
the girl—Kate Harland was her name.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Kate?” Madge’s voice was full
of amazed wonder.</p>

<p>“I mean that——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>The fragile girl paused; then, glancing quickly up
into Madge’s face, she cried:</p>

<p>“You love Jesus, of course, Madge? You are saved,
dear, and looking for His coming?”</p>

<p>For an instant Madge was silent. Then, with a deep
sigh, she replied:</p>

<p>“Oh, me! I am afraid I am not saved, as you call it.
Katie, dear, the fact is——”</p>

<p>She halted in her speech. She did not know how to
put into words all that her friend’s question had aroused
within her.</p>

<p>While she halted thus, the girl at her side put her
arms about her, clasping her with a kind of yearning—an
“I will not let you go” kind of clasp—as she cried,
softly:</p>

<p>“Oh, my darling, you must not lie down to-night until
you know you are Christ’s. Then—then—after that,
nothing can ever matter. Come weal, come woe, come
life, come death, all is well!”</p>

<p class="tb">It was past midnight before the two girls climbed
into their berths, but by that time Madge Finisterre
knew that she had passed from death into life.</p>

<p>Before the vessel reached New York she had learned
something of the truth of the near return of the Lord.</p>

<p>On the quay, when they landed, the two girls bade
each other a sorrowful farewell.</p>

<p>“We shall meet in heaven, Katie, if nevermore on
earth,” sobbed Madge.</p>

<p>“In the air, my darling,” replied the other. “Do not
let us lose sight of that. When our Lord shall come,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Loved ones shall meet in a joyful surprise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Caught up together to Him in the skies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When Jesus shall come once again.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Kate Harland’s friends, who had travelled to meet
her from Denver, carried her off, and Madge took the
car to the Central.</p>

<p>One hour later she boarded the train and began the
last lap of her long journey.</p>

<p>Her spirits rose higher every moment. She had conceived
a very bold idea, and she was going to carry it
through after her own fashion. She sent no message
of warning of her coming, as this would spoil her little
plot.</p>

<p>Her eyes rested delightedly upon every place she
passed. At Garrisons, where the train waited a few
minutes, she caught a glimpse of the father of the man
whom she was hurrying to meet.</p>

<p>The white-haired old father lived at Garrisons, and
was a preacher of the Gospel, like his son. He was
leaving the depot as her train pulled up. She easily
recognized him, because several times during his son’s
pastorate at Balhang he had been to see him, staying
a week at a time, and preaching once on the Sunday on
each occasion.</p>

<p>At Duchess Junction she had to change trains. To
her joy, she met no one from Balhang; there was not
a soul at the depot whom she even knew by sight.</p>

<p>Just before her train reached Balhang she donned a
thick brown gauze veil. No one could see her face
through this to recognize it. There would be nothing
to detain her at the depot, for her baggage was all
“expressed.”</p>

<p>The train stopped; she alighted. Several people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
peered hard at her, the depot manager especially, as
he took her check, but no one recognized her. She
passed on. Twenty yards from the depot she met Judge
Anstey.</p>

<p>She stopped him with a “Good day, Judge; can I
speak with you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, madam,” the official replied genially.</p>

<p>“Come aside, Judge,” she whispered. “I don’t want
anyone to recognize me, or to hear what I am saying to
you, should people pass.”</p>

<p>As he moved on by her side in the direction she
wished, she whispered:</p>

<p>“I have put on this thick veil, Judge, so as not to be
recognized. I am Madge Finisterre.”</p>

<p>“Du say!” he gasped. “I knew the voice, but could
not recall whose it was. I hadn’t heard a breath of
your coming home, Miss Madge.”</p>

<p>“I let no one, not even mumma and poppa, know that
I was coming,” she replied. “The fact is, Judge——”</p>

<p>She was glad, as she prepared to take him into her
confidence, that the thick veil would hide the hot colour
that she felt leaped into her face.</p>

<p>“Momma wrote me,” she went on, “that the pastor
was very sick, and that the doctor didn’t understand
his case. I only got the letter last Saturday morning.
The boat was to start that day at two; but I caught
it, for I knew that would cure the pastor.”</p>

<p>She felt how fiercely the blushes burned in her cheeks,
but, assured that he could not see them, she went on:</p>

<p>“Just before I started for Europe, Judge, pastor told
me he loved me, and asked me to be his wife——”</p>

<p>She watched the amused amaze leap into the Judge’s
face, and smiled herself at his low whistle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>“I told him,” she continued, “I could make him no
definite promise, as I was not quite sure of myself; but
that, when I was, I would not wait for him to ask me
again—I would come and tell him. I am going straight
to him now, Judge, and I want you to give me a clear
quarter of an hour’s start. While I am gone to fix him
up and to make him happy, I want you to go ’long to
mumma and poppa, and bring them right along with
you, and marry me and pastor as soon as you git up to
us. So-long for a quarter of an hour.”</p>

<p>Without another word she moved swiftly away.</p>

<p>“She’s tropical!” he laughed, as he saw her making
for Mrs. Keller’s, where the pastor boarded.</p>

<p class="tb">The French windows of the pastor’s sitting-room were
open, for the day was like a spring one. Madge moved
quickly across the patch of grass, mounted the stoop,
and peered in.</p>

<p>In a large rocker, looking very frail and ill, the
young pastor was lying back with his eyes closed.</p>

<p>Madge felt her eyes fill with tears. She lifted the
disguising veil, and wiped the salt drops away. She
did not lower her veil again, but with a little glad cry
of—</p>

<p>“Homer, dear love!” she crossed the threshold, and
dropped on her knees by his side, flung her arms around
his neck, and laid her hot lips to his.</p>

<p>It was like a dream to him—a wondrous, delicious
dream. His thin arms clasped her. His kisses were
rained upon her, but at first he found no words to say.
Between their passionately-exchanged kisses she poured
out, in rapid, caress-punctured speech, how she came to
be there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>“I have not seen mumma or poppa yet,” she explained;
“but I met Judge Anstey down by the depot. I have
sent him home for mumma and poppa; they will be here
in no time now. The Judge will come with them, and will
marry us right off, dear. For, say, you do want some
nursing.”</p>

<p>He found his voice at last, declared that her coming,
her first kiss, had made him strong; that he would need
no nursing now that she had come. Getting on to his
feet, he gathered her into his arms, and rained fresh
kisses upon her lips, her cheeks, her brow, her eyes.</p>

<p>She managed to whisper the good news, “I have found
Jesus, dear, or He found me, and now——”</p>

<p>A sound of voices and of hurrying steps outside
checked her. She had only time to tear herself from
his arms when her mother and father reached her side.</p>

<p>An hour later, when the Judge had been and gone
again, Madge Finisterre was the wife of the pastor.</p>

<span class="smaller">CASTING A SHOE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was two hours after midnight when Tom Hammond
was free at last. But he did not go to bed. His soul
was disturbed. What he had heard at the major’s
meeting had stirred a myriad disquieting thoughts within
him, and now that he was clear to do it, he shut himself
up alone with a Bible, and began to go over every point
of the major’s address. He had taken copious notes in
shorthand, paying especial attention to the texts quoted
and referred to.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour he looked up from his Bible.
There was a wondering amaze in his eyes, a strange,
perplexed knitting of his brows.</p>

<p>“It is all most marvellous!” he murmured. “There
is not a flaw or hitch anywhere in the major’s statements
or reasoning. The Scriptures prove, to the hilt,
every word that he uttered.”</p>

<p>He smiled to himself as, rising to his feet, he said
aloud,</p>

<p>“I should not sleep if I went to bed; I will go out.”</p>

<p>There are ways of getting into some of the London
parks before the regulation hour for opening the gates.
Tom Hammond had often found a way to forestall the
park-opener.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after leaving his chambers he was inside
the park he loved best. Everything was eerily still and
silent. The calm suited his mood. He wanted to feel,
as well as to be, absolutely alone. He had his desire.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
There had been a thick mist over London overnight, but
the atmosphere was as clear as a bell now. The air
was as balmy as a morning in May or September.</p>

<p>There was a faint light from the stars that stabbed
the deep violet sky. He moved slowly, thoughtfully,
through paths as familiar to him as the rooms he occupied
at home.</p>

<p>“And the Christ might come to-day!” he mused. “As
Major H—— showed plainly from the Bible, there is
no other prophetic event to transpire before His coming.”</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously he paused in his walking.</p>

<p>“If,” he cried softly, a certain fearsomeness in his
voice, “if He came to-day, came now, what about me?
Where should I come in?”</p>

<p>He recalled the fact that, according to the major’s
showing, he, Tom Hammond, was quite unprepared for
Christ’s coming, because he was still unsaved. He
shivered slightly as the thought of his unpreparedness
came to him.</p>

<p>With the flashing swiftness of one of memory’s freaks,
there leaped into his mind some lines of Charles Wesley’s.
He had written them, a day or two before, in illustration
of a certain statement in an article on hymnology. They
had not borne any message to his soul then, but now they
seemed like the voicing of his own inmost thoughts.</p>

<p>He walked slowly on, the words falling from his lips
in half-uttered notes.</p>

</div>

<p>“There was something inspiring, something helpful,
in the last verse,” he mused, “but, for the life of me,
I cannot recall it.”</p>

<p>The piping note of a robin from a clump of bush
trees close by broke into his reverie. He lifted his
head sharply and looked around, then upwards. The
stars had paled in the violet dome above him. Somewhere
near, ahead of him, was a piece of ornamental
water. He caught a glimpse of it between the trees.</p>

<p>“Pip-pip!” came again from the robin’s throat. He
remembered Charles Fox, and said softly aloud:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The bird suddenly flew across his path, dropped upon
a low piece of iron fencing, glanced askance at him,
then darted to where a morning meal peeped out of the
damp sod.</p>

<p>Two or three other low, sleepy bird-notes followed,
then the water-fowl began their discordant quacking.
The tremulous flutenotes of a thrush made rich music on
the morning air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>The stars faded out of sight. The cold grey light of
dawning day moved into the eastern horizon. The smell
of the earth grew rank. The air grew keener. The
east slowly reddened. Roofs and towers of houses and
churches grew up slowly, and grey amid the cold light
of the dawn. He turned to face the spot where he
knew the great clock-tower of Westminster could be
seen. A light burned high aloft in the tower, telling that
England’s legislators were still in session.</p>

<p>Slowly, thoughtfully, he turned back to walk home.</p>

<p>“If Christ came at this instant,” he mused, “how many
of those Commoners and Peers would be ready to meet
Him? And what of the teeming millions of this mighty
city? God help us all! What blind fools we are!”</p>

<p class="tb">In spite of his night vigil Tom Hammond was in his
office at his usual hour. He had been there about an
hour when there came a short, sharp rap on the panel
of his room-door. In response to his “Come in!” Joyce,
the drunken reporter lurched in. In some way he had
contrived to elude those on duty in the enquiry-office.</p>

<p>He was the worse for drink, and in response to Hammond’s
sharp queries:</p>

<p>“What do you want? How came you here unannounced?”
he began to “beg the loan of five shillings.”</p>

<p>“Not a copper!” cried Hammond.</p>

<p>Joyce whined for it.</p>

<p>Hammond refused more sharply.</p>

<p>The drunken wretch cringed, whimpered for “just
’arf-a-crown.”</p>

<p>The fellow began to bluster, then to threaten.</p>

<p>“If you don’t leave this room, I’ll hurl you out,” cried
Hammond, “and give you in custody of the police.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>The drunken beast straightened his limp form as well
as he was able, as he hiccoughed:</p>

<p>“All rightsh, Tom Ham’n’d. Every dawg hash hish
day. You’re havin’ yoursh now, all rightsh—all rightsh,—but
I’ll—hic—do fur yer; I’ll—hic—ruin yer; I’ll——”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond darted from his place by the table.
The next instant he would have put his threat of “hurling
out” into execution, but the drunken braggart did not
wait for him, for he shuffled out of the room, cursing
hideously.</p>

<p>As the door closed upon him, Tom Hammond went
across to the window, and flung up the lower sashes, and
drew down the upper ones. From a drawer in a cabinet
he took a strip of scented joss-paper, and lit it. The
sandal-like perfume spread instantly through all the room.</p>

<p>“Faugh!” he muttered. “The whole place seems foul
after his presence.”</p>

<p>He turned to his wash-stand, rolled back the polished
top, and washed his hands.</p>

<p>“I’ll see Ralph,” he muttered, as he dried his hands
“and go out for a couple of hours. I’ll go and see
Cohen.”</p>

<p>It was curious how often he found excuse to visit the
Jew.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later he drove up to the house
of Cohen. He found him, with his wife and Zillah, on
the point of starting for their synagogue.</p>

<p>“One may live a life-time, as a Jew, in this country,”
Cohen explained, “and never see the ceremony that is
about to take place in our synagogue. It is what is
known in our religion as ‘Chalitza.’ Will you go with
us, Mr. Hammond?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>Tom Hammond’s eyes met Zillah’s. Then he promptly
said—</p>

<p>“Yes” to the Jew’s question.</p>

<p>“Right, then! We can explain about the ceremony as
we go!” Cohen said, and the quartette left the house.</p>

<p>There was not much time for explanation, but what
Tom Hammond heard convinced him that he was a fortunate
journalist that day. He had no opportunity of
talking with Zillah, but he found his heart beating with
a strange wildness whenever his eyes met hers—and they
frequently met.</p>

<p>At the door of the synagogue the party had to separate,
the two women going one way, Cohen and Hammond
another. The building was filling very fast. Presently
it was packed to suffocation.</p>

<p>It was Tom Hammond’s first sight of a Jewish congregation
in a synagogue. It amazed him. The hatted
men and bewigged women—these latter sat behind a
grille. The gorgeousness of much of the female finery.
The curious “praying shawls”—the “Talith” of the men.</p>

<p>Suddenly a Rabbi began to intone the opening words
of the service, reading from the roll of the law, “The
Holy Scroll:” “If brethren dwell together, and one of
them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall
not marry without unto a stranger; her husband’s
brother shall take her to wife, and perform the duty of a
husband’s brother to her.... And if the man like not to
take his brother’s wife, then let his brother’s wife go up to
the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband’s brother
refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel,
he will not perform the duty of my husband’s brother.</p>

<p>“Then the elder of the city shall call the man, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not
to take her;</p>

<p>“Then shall his brother’s wife come unto him in the
presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his
foot, and shall spit in his face, and shall answer and say,
‘So shall it be done unto that man that will not build
up his brother’s house.’</p>

<p>“And his name shall be called in Israel, ‘the house of
him that hath his shoe loosed’.”</p>

<p>The service was all very curious in the eyes of Tom
Hammond. He followed every item of it with the
closest, most interested attention. Presently the parties
specially concerned mounted the platform. This platform
was backed with a huge square frame covered with
black cloth. This was meant to symbolize mourning for
the dead husband. Three tall candle-sticks held lighted
candles, their flames looking weird and sickly in the
daylight.</p>

<p>The Rabbi stooped before the brother-in-law, and
took off his right shoe and sock. Another official washed
the foot, wiped it with a towel, and pared the toe-nails.</p>

<p>A soft white shoe, made specially for the occasion,
was then taken by the rabbi, put on to the bare foot of
the man, and laced up very tightly, the long ends of the
lace being twisted round the ankle and knotted securely.</p>

<p>Then there followed a seemingly interminable string
of questions, put by the rabbi, and answered by the
brother-in-law. The catechism culminated in a few chief
questions such as:</p>

<p>“Do you wish to marry this woman?”</p>

<p>“I do not,” replied the brother-in-law.</p>

<p>“For what reason?”</p>

<p>“I am already married; my wife is living, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
law of the land we live in does not permit my having
more than one wife.”</p>

<p>The reply rang clear and strong through the silent
building, and the hush seemed to deepen as the rabbi
asked,</p>

<p>“Will you give this woman Chalitza?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I will, if she wishes it,” replied the brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Turning to the woman, the rabbi asked, “Do you wish
to receive Chalitza?”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond saw how the light of a great eagerness
leaped into the eyes of the beautiful Jewess, and
how her face glowed with the warmth of a sudden
colour, as she replied,</p>

<p>“I do wish for Chalitza, for I desire to marry again.”</p>

<p>The rabbi’s assistant gave her certain instructions, and
she knelt before her brother-in-law, and with the thumb
and finger of her right hand—she dare not use the left,
however difficult her task might prove,—she began untying
the knots in the lace fastenings around the ankle.</p>

<p>It was no child’s play to unfasten the shoe. The knots
had been drawn very tight; but she was very determined,
and presently a deep sigh of relief broke from the breathless,
watching congregation, as, taking the shoe from
the man’s foot, she flung it sharply down, twice, upon the
floor.</p>

<p>She rose now to her feet to complete the ceremony.
The law of spitting in the face of the man had been
modified to meet the views of a day less gross than when
it was carried out in full coarseness.</p>

<p>The brother-in-law took a couple of paces backwards,
and the beautiful widow spat on the place he had stood a
moment before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>Then she faced the great congregation. Her eyes travelled
straight to the face of the man she loved, whom
she was shortly to marry. Her eyes danced with excitement,
her cheeks were rosy with colour, her whole face
was full of an indescribable rapture, as she cried:</p>

<p>“I am free!”</p>

<p>“True, sister, you are free!” the brother-in-law
responded.</p>

<p>The rabbi moved swiftly to her side, and, looking into
her face, said:</p>

<p>“O woman of Israel, you are free!”</p>

<p>With a shout that reminded Tom Hammond of the
shout, “He is risen!” at the Easter service in the Greek
churches of Russia, the excited, perspiring congregation
cried: “Woman, you are free!”</p>

<p>A moment or two later the service concluded, and the
building emptied. Walking homeward by Hammond’s
side, Cohen said, “Only the most orthodox of Jews would
dream of using Chalitza to free themselves for re-marrying.
This is the only case I have personally known.
By-the-bye, Mr. Hammond, it is said that about the
middle of the eighteenth century that one of the Rothschild
widows sought Chalitza, but failed to untie the lace
of the shoe, and was disqualified from re-marrying.”</p>

<p>Cohen’s wife had stopped to speak to some friends.
The young Jew joined her. Tom Hammond found himself
moving forward by Zillah’s side.</p>

<p>“What an extraordinary service that was, Miss
Robart!” he said.</p>

<p>“It was!” she glanced almost shyly away from him,
for, unknown to himself his eyes were full of the warmest
admiration.</p>

<p>“Do you think, Miss Robart,” he went on, “if you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
were situated as was that beautiful woman whom we
have just seen freed from the Mosaic bond, that you
would have braved the Chalitza ceremony, or would you
have taken advantage of the English law and——”</p>

<p>She lifted her great, black, lustrous eyes to his in a
sudden gaze of utter frankness, as, interrupting him,
she cried:</p>

<p>“I would certainly not marry any man, save one whom
I could wholly revere and love!”</p>

<p>“Happy the man whom you shall thus honour, Miss
Robart!”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond barely whispered the words, and she
was not wholly sure that he meant them for her ears.
She did not respond in any way. But she was conscious
that his gaze was fixed upon her. She was equally
conscious that she was blushing furiously.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was to give her a chance of recovering
herself, that his next question was on quite a different
topic.</p>

<p>“Are you, Miss Robart,” he said, “wholly wedded to
the Jewish faith? Do you believe, for instance, that
Jesus, the Nazarene, was an impostor?”</p>

<p>He heard the catch that came into her throat. Then,
with a half-frightened look around, she lifted her melting
eyes to his, as she said, “I can trust you, Mr. Hammond,
I know. You will keep my confidence, if I give
it to you?”</p>

<p>His eyes answered her, and she went on.</p>

<p>“I have not dared to breathe a word of it to anyone,
not even to my good brother-in-law Abraham, but I am
learning to love the Christ.”</p>

<p>Her face was filled with a holy light, her cheeks glowed
with excitement, as she went on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>“I see how the prophecies of our forefathers—Isaiah
especially—were all literally fulfilled in the life and work
of Jesus of Nazareth. I see, too, that when next He
comes, it will not be as our race supposes, as the Messiah
to the Jews, but He will come in the air, and——”</p>

<p>She glanced sharply round. Some instinct told her
her friends were coming.</p>

<p>“No more now,” she whispered. “I will tell you more
another time. I shall myself know more, to-night. I
go twice a week to a mission-room at Spitalfields——”</p>

<p>“What time?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Seven,” she replied, not realizing the eagerness of his
tone.</p>

<p>“Where is this place?” he went on.</p>

<p>She had just time to tell him. When Cohen and his
wife came up, husband and wife began talking together.
Zillah appeared to listen, but in reality she heard nothing
of what they were saying. For a strange thing had
happened.</p>

<p>She had dropped her hand by her side as the Cohens
had rejoined them, and had suddenly found her fingers
clasped in Hammond’s hand.</p>

<p>What did it mean? she wondered. They had met
often of late. She had read an unmistakable ardency
in his eyes very often, when her glance met his. And,
deep in her own heart, she knew that all the woman-love
she would ever have to give a man she had unconsciously
given to him. Was this sudden secret handclasp of his
a silent expression of love on his part, or was it meant
merely as an assurance of sympathy in the matter of her
new faith?</p>

<p>She could not be sure which it was, but she let her
plump fingers give a little pressure of response. How<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
did he translate this response? she wondered. She had
no means of deciding, save that her heart leaped wildly
in a tumultuous delight as she felt how he literally gripped
her fingers in a closer, warmer clasp.</p>

<p>They had reached the house by this time. Hammond
would not go in. He shook hands, in parting, with each,
but his hold upon Zillah’s hand was longer than on the
others. He pressed the fingers meaningly, and his eyes
held an ardency that gave a new tumult to her heart.</p>

<p>As she passed into the house she whispered to herself,
“Will he be at Spitalfields to-night?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">TOLD IN A CAB.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">A quarter</span> of an hour before the time Zillah had
given him, Tom Hammond was waiting near the
“Mission Hall for Jews,” where the meeting was to be
held. He was anxious that she should not know of his
proximity, so kept out of sight,—there were many possibilities
of this among the various stalls in the gutter-way.</p>

<p>Presently he saw her coming, and the light of a glad
admiration leaped into his eyes. “What a superb face
and figure she has!” he mused. “What a perfect queen
of a woman she is!”</p>

<p>From behind a whelk-stall he watched her cross over
to the door of the Hall. Here she paused a moment,
and glanced around.</p>

<p>“I believe she half expected to see me somewhere
near!” he murmured to himself.</p>

<p>She entered the Hall. By the time her head was
bowed in prayer, he had entered, and had taken a seat
on the last form, the fourth behind hers. When she
first raised her head from her silent prayer, she looked
around and backward. In her heart she was hoping he
would be there. If he had not been bending in prayer,
she must have seen him. After that she turned no more,
the service soon occupied all her thoughts.</p>

<p>He too became utterly absorbed by the service, of
which the address was the chief feature. It was largely
expository, and from the first utterance of the speaker,
it riveted Tom Hammond’s attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>The speaker, himself a converted Jew, took as his
text Deut. xxi. 22, 23.</p>

<p>“If a man have committed a sin worthy of death,
and is sentenced to death, and thou hang him on a tree,
his corpse shall not remain all night upon the tree, but,
burying, thou shalt bury him on that day (because he
who is hanged is accursed of God).”</p>

<p>“Now, brethren,” the speaker went on, “as far as I
have been able to discover, in all the Hebrew records I
have been able to consult, and in all the histories of our
race, I have not found a single reference to a Hebrew
official hanging of a criminal on a tree. To what, then,
does this verse refer, and why is it placed on Jehovah’s
statute-book?”</p>

<p>For a few moments he appealed to his Jewish hearers
on points peculiarly Hebraic. Then presently he said,</p>

<p>“Now let us see if the New Testament will shed any
light upon this.”</p>

<p>Turning rapidly the leaves of his Bible, he went on:
“There is a book in the Christian Scriptures known as
the Epistle to the Galatians which, in the tenth verse
of the third chapter, repeats our own word from Deuteronomy:</p>

<p>“‘Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things
which are written in the Book of the Law to do them,’
and in the thirteenth verse says, ‘Christ hath redeemed us
from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us:
for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a
tree.’</p>

<p>“We all, brethren, as the sons of Abraham, believe
that our father David’s Psalm beginning, ‘My God, my
God, why hast Thou forsaken me?’ was never written
out of his own experience, but was prophetic of some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
other Person. Now, let me quote you some of the words
of that Psalm.”</p>

<p>In clear, succinct language, the speaker, quoting verse
after verse of the Psalm, showed how literally the descriptions
fitted into a death by crucifixion. Referring
to the Gospel narratives of the death on the cross, he
showed how they also fitted in with the description of
Christ’s death, and how Christ actually took upon His
dying lips the cry of the Psalm, “My God, My God, why
hast Thou forsaken Me?”</p>

<p>Then with wondrous clearness he referred to parts
of Isaiah liii., and, continuing his theme, showed that it
was evident that only one particular type of death could
have atoned for the sin of the human race, a death that
would render the dying one accursed of the Almighty.
The only death that would fully carry out that condition
was crucifixion.</p>

<p>“Our race waited for the Messiah,” he cried, “and
He came. Our prophet Micah said, ‘Yet thou, O Bethlehem-Ephratah,
little as thou art amidst the thousands
of Judah, yet out of thee shall proceed from Me, One
who is to be ruler in Israel!”</p>

<p>“The Christ was born at the only time in the world’s
history when He could have been executed on a tree—crucified.
At a time when the Roman—crucifixion was
a Roman punishment—swayed our beloved land of Jewry.
So that Paul, the great Jew, chosen of God to be apostle
to the Gentiles, wrote after the crucifixion of Jesus,
the Nazarene, ‘According to the time, Christ died.’”</p>

<p>For some minutes the speaker appealed to his Jewish
hearers with a wonderful power. Then finally addressing
not only the Jews, but any Gentiles who might
be present, he cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>“We must know the meaning of sin, brethren, before
we can understand the mystery of a crucified Christ.
A beheaded, a stoned Christ, could not have atoned for
a guilty world, but only a God-cursed death, a tree-cursed
death could have done this.</p>

<p>“And Christ was cursed for us—He who knew no
curse of His own. Ah! beloved, the guilt of the human
race is the key to the cross.</p>

<p>“Times change, customs change, but sin remains, sin
is ever the same, and only a living, personal trust in
the crucified Christ can ever deliver the unsaved sinner
from the wrath of God which abideth on him.”</p>

<p>The address closed. Tom Hammond awoke from
his intense absorption of soul. He had long since utterly
forgotten Zillah. He had seen only himself, at first,
his own sin, and that his sin had nailed Christ to the
cross. Then, better still, he saw the Christ.</p>

<p>Only a few nights before he had paused to watch a
Salvation Army open-air meeting. The girl-officer in
charge of the corps had announced thirty-eight as the
number of the hymn they would sing, and prefaced the
reading of the first verse by saying:</p>

<p>“This hymn was written by an ex-drunkard—an ex-blasphemer.
His name was Newton—drunken Jack
Newton, he was often called by his mates, and by others
who knew him. He was a sailor, on a ship trading to
the African coast, at the time when his soul was aroused
to its danger. He was in agony, not knowing what to
do to get rest and peace.</p>

<p>“One night he was keeping anchor-watch. He was
alone on the deck, the night was dark and eerie. His sins
troubled him. All that he had heard of the crucified
Christ—whom he had so often blasphemed—swept into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
his soul, and he groaned in the misery of his sin-convicted
state.</p>

<p>“Suddenly he paused in his deck-pacing, and looked
up. To his fevered imagination, the yard which crossed
the mast high up above his head appeared like a mighty
cross, and it was remembering this, with all the soul-experience
of that night, that in after years, when he
became a preacher of the gospel, and a noted divine, Dr.
John Newton wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I saw One hanging on a tree</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In agonies and blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who fixed His dying eyes on me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As near the cross I stood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘A second look He gave, which said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“I freely all forgive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My blood was for thy ransom paid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I die that thou may’st live.’””</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Recalling these words now, Tom Hammond’s soul
received the great Revelation. He heard no word of the
closing hymn and prayer, but passed out into the open
air a new man in Christ.</p>

<p>The mission-leader had given an invitation to any
who would like to be helped in soul matters to remain
behind. Tom Hammond noticed that Zillah lingered.</p>

<p>It was half-an-hour before she came out. Tom Hammond
had lived a life-time of wonder in the thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Like one in a delicious dream Zillah walked on a few
yards. Suddenly she became aware of Tom Hammond’s
presence at her side.</p>

<p>“Zillah!”</p>

<p>He gave her no other word of greeting. It was the
first time he had ever called the young girl by her
first name. He took her hand, and drew it through his
arm. She barely noticed the tender action, for her soul<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
was rioting in a new-found joy, and she poured out, in
a few sentences, all the story of her supreme trust in
Christ the Nazarene.</p>

<p>His voice was hoarse with many emotions, as he said,</p>

<p>“I, too, Zillah, have to-night seen Jesus Christ dying
for my sin, and have taken Him for my own personal
Saviour!”</p>

<p>Suddenly she realized how closely he was holding
her to his side, how tight was the clasp of his hand upon
hers. She looked up into his face to express her joy
at his new-found faith. Their eyes met. A new meaning
flashed in their exchanged glances.</p>

<p>A four-wheeled cab moved slowly along in the gutter-way,
the driver uttered a low “Keb, keb!”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond seized the opportune offer, and whispered,</p>

<p>“Let us take a cab, Zillah. I have something to say
to you which I must say to-night.”</p>

<p>Before scarcely she realized it, she was seated by his
side in the cab.</p>

<p>There is a moment in every woman’s life when her
heart warns her of the coming of the great event in that
life, when love is to be offered to her by the only man
who has ever loomed large enough in her consciousness
to be able to affect her existence.</p>

<p>This moment had suddenly unexpectedly come to
Zillah Robart.</p>

<p>Her heart warned her that the crisis was upon her.
She had done nothing to precipitate it. It had met
her, drawn her aside, and had shut her up in the semi-darkness
of this vehicle with the only man she could
ever love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>The cab rattled over the cobbles of that wide East-end
thoroughfare, past the throngs of moving pedestrians,
though, to her consciousness, the whole wide world consisted
of but one man—the man at her side.</p>

<p>He had secured her hand, he held it in his strong,
hot clasp. She held her breath in a strange, expectant
ecstasy. Then the inevitable came. She felt its coming.</p>

<p>Tom Hammond was drawing her closer to himself.
She was yielding to that drawing. She caught her
breath again, and as she did so a rush of strange tears
filled her eyes.</p>

<p>“Zillah!” his voice was hoarse and deep.</p>

<p>She realized the meaning of the hoarseness. She
knew by her own feeling that the depth and intensity
of his voice was due to the emotion that filled him. She
knew she would have found herself voiceless at that
moment had she tried to speak.</p>

<p>“I love you, my darling!” he went on. “I have loved
you from the first instant I met you. You have felt it,
known it, dear. Have you not?”</p>

<p>She tried to speak, her lips moved, but no sound came
from them. But she looked into his eyes, and he read
his answer.</p>

<p>With a sweeping gesture of passionate love he gathered
her into his arms and showered kisses upon her lips, her
cheeks, her forehead, her hair.</p>

<p>She lay like a stunned thing in his arms. Her joy
was almost greater than she could bear. Then as his
hot lips sought hers again, she awoke from her semi-trance
of ecstasy, and with a little sob she flung her
arms upwards and clasped them about his neck, crying,</p>

<p>“Love you, my darling? Love seems too poor a word
to express my feeling, for God knows that, save my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
Lord Jesus, to whom to-night I have fully yielded, you
are all my life.”</p>

<p>Her voice was stifled with a little rush of tears. Where
she lay on his breast, he felt how all her frame quivered.</p>

<p>“And you will be mine, dear Zillah—and soon?” His
eyes burned into hers, asking for an answer as loudly
as his lips.</p>

<p>She did not answer him for a moment. Her heart
beat with a tumultuous gladness, and her brain throbbed
with the wonder of what she conceived to be the honour
that had come to her. Wondering incredulity mingled
with the rapturous ecstasy that filled her.</p>

<p>“But you are so great—so——” She paused, she
could find no words to express all that prospective
wifedom to him appeared to her.</p>

<p>He smiled down into her eyes. Her loveliness seemed
to him greater than ever before.</p>

<p>“You seem like a king to me!” she gasped at last.</p>

<p>“You, Zillah,” he smiled, “do not seem, you are, a
queen to me. Say, darling, the one word that shall
fill all my soul with delight—say that you will be mine—and
soon, very soon!”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>There was the intensity of a mighty love in her utterance
of the two words.</p>

<p>He gathered her to himself in an even closer embrace,
and spent his kisses on her lips.</p>

<p>The flush of pride, of love, burned deeper in her face.</p>

<p>“Oh, why is it given to me to have such bliss?” she
murmured.</p>

<p>The words were low-breathed; they sounded like a
gasping sigh of delight more than a voiced utterance.</p>

<p>For a moment, clasped tightly in his arms, she was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
silent, and he uttered no word. Presently he whispered,</p>

<p>“Will it give you joy, I wonder, my darling, to know
that I have been a man free of all woman’s love before?
I have seen many women, in many lands, the loveliest of
the earth—though none so lovely as you, my sweetheart.
It is no egotism on my part, either, to say that many
women have sought my love by their smiles and favour.
But none ever won a word of love or response from me.”</p>

<p>The cab was passing a great central light in the heart
of a junction of four roads. Her eyes, full of a great
rapture, sought his. His were fixed upon her face, and
filled with a love so great that again she caught her
breath in wonder.</p>

<p>“But you, my Zillah!” He caught her close to himself
again, and bending his head, let his lips cling to hers,
“But you, darling!” he continued, “have been to me all
that the heart of man could ever wish for, from the
first moment I met you. May God give us a long life
together, dearest, and make us (with our new-born faith
in Him) to be the best, the holiest help-meets, the one
to the other, that this world has ever known.”</p>

<p>Where she lay in his arms, he felt her tremble with
the intensity of her joy. As he looked down into the
deep, dreamy lustrousness of her eyes, he saw how they
were full of a far-off look, as though she was picturing
that united future of which he had spoken.</p>

<p>Perhaps he read that look in her eyes aright. Then,
as he watched her, he saw how the colour deepened in
her face. She slowly, proudly, yet with a glad frankness,
lifted herself in his arms until, in a tender, passionate
caress, her lips rested upon his in the first spontaneous
kiss she had given him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>“If the Christ, to whom we have given ourselves
to-night, should tarry,” she whispered, “and we are spared
to dwell together on earth as husband and wife, dear
Tom, may God answer all that prayer of yours abundantly.”</p>

<p>The cab turned a corner sharply at that moment. He
looked through the window. They were within a few
hundred yards of where he had given the driver orders
to stop. Zillah would have, on alighting, only the length
of a short street to traverse before reaching home, and
he would take a hansom and drive back to the office.
But the intervening moments before they would part were
very precious, and love took unlimited toll in those swift,
fleeting moments.</p>

<span class="smaller">TOM HAMMOND REVIEWING.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was the morning after Tom Hammond had found
Christ, and had closed with the great offer of redemption.
He had scarcely slept for the joy of the two loves
that had so suddenly come into his life.</p>

<p>During the sleepless hours, he had learned, for the
first time in his life, the true secret of prayer, and
that even greater secret, that of communion.</p>

<p>With real prayer there is always a certain degree of
communion, but real, deep, soul-filling communion is
more often found in seasons when the communing one
asks for nothing, but, silent before his or her God, the
sense of the Divine fills all the being, and if the lips utter
any sound it is the cry, “My Lord and my God!”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond, reviewing all that God had revealed
to him, learned in those first hours of his new birth
the secret of adoring communion with God.</p>

<p>In the book of extracts he had been reading in the
tube train at the moment when he had first heard of
Major H——’s coming address on the Second Advent,
he had come across one headed, “Frederick William
Faber: The Precious Blood—chap. iv.” He had at the
time been considerably impressed with the extract, though
there was a certain note about it which he had failed
to understand. In the flush of the great revelation that
had come to his soul (in that little meeting at Spitalfields),
he now found the book, and re-read the extract:</p>

<p>“I was upon the sea-shore; and my heart filled with
love it knew not why. Its happiness went out over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
wide waters, and upon the unfettered wind, and swelled
up into the free dome of blue sky until it filled it. The
dawn lighted up the faces of the ivory cliffs, which the
sun and sea had been blanching for centuries of God’s
unchanging love. The miles of noiseless sands seemed
vast, as if they were the floors of eternity. Somehow,
the daybreak was like eternity. The idea came over
me of that feeling of acceptance which so entrances the
soul just judged and just admitted into heaven.</p>

<p>“‘To be saved!’ I said to myself, ‘to be saved!’</p>

<p>“Then the thoughts of all the things implied in salvation
came in one thought upon me; and I said:</p>

<p>“‘This is the one grand joy of life;’ and I clapped my
hands like a child, and spoke to God aloud. But then
there came many thoughts, all in one thought, about the
nature and manner of our salvation. To be saved with
such a salvation!</p>

<p>“This was a grander joy, the second grand joy of life;
and I tried to say some lines of a hymn but the words
were choked in my throat. The ebb was sucking the
sea down over the sand quite silently; and the cliffs were
whiter, and more day-like. Then there came many more
thoughts all in one thought, and I stood still without
intending it.</p>

<p>“To be saved by such a Saviour! This was the grandest
joy of all, the third grand joy of life; and it swallowed
up the other joys; and after it there could be on
earth no higher joy.</p>

<p>“I said nothing; but I looked at the sinking sea as
it reddened in the morning. Its great heart was throbbing
in the calm; and methought I saw the precious blood
of Jesus in heaven, throbbing that hour with real human
love of me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured Tom Hammond, “after all, to be
saved by such a Saviour is a greater, higher, holier
thought than the mere knowledge that one is saved, or
of the realization of what that salvation comprises.”</p>

<p>In every way that night was one never to be forgotten
by Tom Hammond. He needed, too, all the strength
born of his new communion with God to meet what
awaited him with the coming of the new day’s daily
papers.</p>

<p>The paper whom whose staff he had been practically
dismissed in our first chapter (the editor of which was
his bitterest enemy) had found how to use “the glass
stiletto.”</p>

<p>Some of the most scurrilous paragraphs ever penned
appeared in his enemy’s columns that morning. It is
true that the identity of the man slandered (Tom Hammond)
was veiled, but so thinly—so devilishly—that
every journalist, and a myriad other readers, would know
against whom the scurrilous utterances were hurled.</p>

<p>Tom Hammond would not have been human if the
reading of the paragraphs had not hurt him. And he
would not have been “partaker of the Divine nature,”
as he now was, if he had not found a balm in the committal
of his soreness to God.</p>

<p>“That is the work of that fellow Joyce,” he told
himself.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours before, if this utterance had had
to have been made by him, he would have said,</p>

<p>“That beast Joyce!” But already, as a young soldier
of Christ, the promised watch was set upon his lips. In
the strength of the two great loves that had come into
his life—the love of Christ and the love of Zillah Robart—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
scurrilous paragraphs affected him comparatively
little.</p>

<p>When he had skimmed the papers, attended to his
correspondence, and to one or two other special items,
he took pen and paper and began to write to his
betrothed.</p>

<p>His pen flew over the smooth surface of the paper, but
his thoughts were even quicker than his pen. His whole
being palpitated with love. It was the love of his highest
ideal. The love which he had sometimes dared to
hope might some day be his, but which he had scarcely
dared to expect.</p>

<p>The memory of his passing fancy for Madge Finisterre
crossed his mind, once, as he wrote. He paused
with the pen poised in his fingers, and smiled that he
should ever have thought it possible that he was beginning
to love her. “I liked her, admired her,” he mused.
“I enjoyed her frank, open friendship, but love her—no,
no. The word cannot be named in the same breath as
my feeling for Zillah.”</p>

<p>He put his pen to the paper again, and poured out all
the wealth of the love of his heart to his beautiful
betrothed. When he had finally finished the letter, he
sent it by special messenger to Zillah.</p>

<p>He had not forgotten that Major H——’s second
meeting was that day. Three o’clock found him again
in the hall. This time it was quite full. There was
a new sense of interest, of understanding, present within
him as he entered the place. This time he bowed his
head in real prayer.</p>

<p>The preliminary proceedings were almost identically
like those of the previous occasion, except that the hymn
sung—though equally new to Hammond—was different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
to either of those sung at the first meeting. But, if
anything, he was more struck by the words than he had
been with those of the other hymns.</p>

<p>And how rapturously the people sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Till He come!’ Oh, let the words</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Linger on the trembling chords;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let the ‘little while’ between</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In their golden light be seen;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us think how heaven and home</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lie beyond that ‘Till He come!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This time a lady, a returned Chinese missionary, led
prayer, and then the major resumed his subject.</p>

<p>“We saw, dear friends, at our last meeting,” the grand
old soldier-preacher began, “what were some of the
prophesied signs of our Lord’s second coming and how
literally these signs were being fulfilled in our midst
to-day. This afternoon, God willing, and time permitting,
I want us to see how He will come; what will
happen to the believer; and also what effect the expectancy
of His coming should have upon us, as believers.</p>

<p>“First of all, how will He come? While Jesus, who
had led His disciples out of the city, was in the act of
blessing them, He suddenly rose before their eyes, and a
cloud received Him out of their sight. Have you ever
thought of this fact, beloved, that the cloud itself was a
miracle? Whoever heard of a cloud at that special period
of the year, in Palestine? And I very much doubt if
anyone, save the apostles, in all the country round about,
saw that cloud. If you ask me what I think the cloud
was, I should be inclined to refer you to the 24th Psalm,
and say that the cloud was composed of the angel-convoy,
who, like a guard of honour, escorted the Lord back to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
glory, crying, as they neared the gates of the celestial city,
‘Lift up your heads, oh, ye gates, and let the King of
Glory come in!”</p>

<p>“He went away in a cloud. The angels, addressing
the amazed disciples declared to them that ‘He would
so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go.’</p>

<p>“It may be that to the letter that will be fulfilled, and
that our Lord’s return for His Church will be in an
actual cloud. I think it is probable it will. Anyway, we
know that He will come ‘in the air,’ for Paul, to whom
was given, by God, the privilege of revealing to His
Church the great mystery of the second coming of our
Lord, and who said, in this connection:</p>

<p>“‘Behold, I show you a mystery: we shall not all sleep,
but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling
of an eye,’ when writing more explicitly to the church
at Thessalonica, said:</p>

<p>“‘For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,
that we which are alive and remain unto the coming
of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For
the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a
shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the
trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the
air; and so shall ever be with the Lord. Wherefore
comfort one another with these words.’</p>

<p>“Now, beloved, can any words be plainer, simpler,
than these of Paul’s, forming, as they do, the climax
to all that has gone before in the New Testament. Jesus
had Himself said,</p>

<p>“‘I will come again and receive you unto Myself.’</p>

<p>“The angels said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>“‘In like manner as ye have seen Him go, He shall
come again,’ and now Paul amplifies this manner of His
coming, while, at the same time, he emphasizes the fact
of that return.</p>

<p>“Now let us look, dear friends, at the separate items
of that detailed coming. We have already, more than
once, alluded to the secrecy of the return of our Lord
for His people, and people are puzzled over the language
used by Paul’s description of the return. ‘The Lord
shall come with a shout.’ Then the world at large will
hear Him coming? No; we think not. Or, if they hear
a sound, they will not understand it.</p>

<p>“The Lord’s voice in His spiritual revelations is never
heard save by the Lord’s people. But there is the voice
of the archangel—how about that? The same rule
applies to that, we think.</p>

<p>“There were godly shepherds watching their flocks at
night, near Bethlehem, and there was a whole host of
angels singing, but the Bethlehemites did not hear. No
one appears to have heard or seen anything save the
godly shepherds. The same, we believe, applies to the
‘trump,’ the call of God.</p>

<p>“In this connection it is interesting to note a fact that
probably was in the mind of Paul when he wrote thus
to the Thessalonians. The Roman army used three
special trumpet-calls in connection with departure—with
marching.</p>

<p>“The first meant, ‘Pull down tents.’</p>

<p>“The second, ‘Get in array.’</p>

<p>“The third, ‘Start.’</p>

<p>“Did Paul, moved by the Holy Ghost, translate these
three clarion notes in the topic of 1 Thess. iv. 16, after
this fashion:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>“1. ‘The Lord Himself.’</p>

<p>“2. ‘Voice of the archangel.’</p>

<p>“3. ‘The trump of God.’</p>

<p>“But leaving that, again I would emphasize this truth,
that it is only the trained ear of the spiritually-awakened
soul which ever hears the call of God. We believe that
all Scripture teaches the secrecy as well as the suddenness
of the rapture of the church.</p>

<p>“In all the many appearances of the risen, resurrected
Lord Jesus, during the many weeks between the resurrection
and the ascension, even though, on one occasion,
at least, He was seen by 500 disciples at once, yet there
is no hint, either in the Word of God or in the records
of history of that time, that Jesus was ever seen by the
eye of an unbeliever. And depend upon it, no eye will
see, no ear will hear Him, when He comes again, save
those who are in Christ.</p>

<p>“‘The world seeth Me no more’ our Lord said, ‘but
ye see Me.’ ‘Him God raised up the third day, and
gave Him to be made manifest, not to all the people, but
unto witnesses that were chosen before God, even to
us who did eat and drink with Him after He rose from
the dead.’</p>

<p>“When the voice of the Father came from heaven,
witnessing to Jesus’ truth, the people that stood by
failed to hear it as a voice, but exclaimed,—‘It thunders.’
In the case of Paul on the way to Damascus, those
with him heard nothing understandable.</p>

<p>“Enoch was taken secretly. Noah was shut into the
ark before the flood came. Only Israel, at Sinai, and
not the surrounding nations, understood those awful
physical manifestations of God’s power. Elijah was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
taken secretly. The nation neither saw nor heard anything
of it.</p>

<p>“When will He come? I do not know; no one knows
exactly; but this we do know, from the Word of God—that
nothing remains to be fulfilled before He comes.
He may come before this meeting closes. Again we
know by every sign of the times that His coming can
not now be delayed much longer.</p>

<p>“Now to a very important feature as to the truth of
the second coming of the Lord. There are many who
argue that such teaching will tend to make the Christian
worker careless of his work, his life, etc. There was
never a more foolish argument advanced.</p>

<p>“First take a concrete illustration that gives the flat
denial to it—namely, that the most spiritual-minded
workers, at home and abroad, are those whose hearts
(not heads only) are saturated with, not the doctrine
merely, but the expectancy of their Lord’s near return.
Then, too, every such worker finds an incentive to
redoubled service in the remembrance that every soul
saved through their instrumentality brings the Lord’s
return nearer—‘hasting His coming’—since, when the last
unit composing His Church has been gathered in, He will
come.</p>

<p>“Scripture, dear friends, is most plain, most emphatic,
in its statements that the effect of living in momentary
expectancy of our Lord’s return touches the spiritual
life and service at every point. ‘We know,’ wrote John,
‘that when He shall appear we shall be like Him, for we
shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath this
hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.’ That,
beloved, is the general statement. Now let us look at
some of the separate particular statements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>“Writing to the Philippians, Paul connects heavenly
mindedness with the return of the Lord for His Church
saying, ‘For our conversation’—our manner of living, our
citizenship—‘is in heaven; from whence also we look for
the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.’ To the Colossians
the great apostle showed how the coming of the Lord was
to be the incentive to mortification of self. ‘When Christ,
who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear
with Him in glory. Mortify, therefore, your members
which are upon the earth,’ etc. James taught that the
real cure for impatience was this dwelling in the hope and
expectancy of our Lord’s coming again. ‘Be ye also
patient,’ he wrote; ‘stablish your hearts; for the coming
of the Lord draweth nigh!’ We live in an age which is
cursed with impatience—children, young men and women,
parents, business people, domestic people, pastors, Christian
workers, Sunday-school teachers, all alike have their
spiritual lives and their work marred by impatience. A
real, moment-by-moment heart-apprehension of the possible
coming of Jesus in the next moment of time, is the
only real cure for this universal impatience in the Christian
Church.</p>

<p>“Then take another great sin in the Church, beloved—censoriousness.
Oh, the damage it does to the one
who indulges in it, and the suffering it causes to the one
who is the victim of it. But here, again, a full, a constant
realization of the near coming of our Lord will
check censoriousness. Writing to the Corinthians, in his
first epistle, Paul says, ‘Therefore, judge nothing before
the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light
the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the
counsels of the hearts.’</p>

<p>“The great quickener, too, of Christian diligence is to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
be found in the coming of the Lord. Peter writes to us
saying, ‘But the day of the Lord will come as a thief
in the night, ... seeing then that these things shall be,
... what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy
living and godliness; looking for and hasting the coming....
Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for
such things, be diligent that ye may be found of Him
in peace, without spot, and blameless.’</p>

<p>“May I say, too, in all gentleness and love, that it
has seemed to me, for years, that the missing link in
nearly all ‘holiness’ preaching (so called) is this much-neglected
expectancy of our Lord’s return. Paul connects
holiness and the second coming of Christ, in his
first epistle to the Thessalonians, saying, ‘The God of
peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your spirit,
soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming
of our Lord Jesus Christ.’</p>

<p>“The scoff of the world, dear friends, against us, as
Christians, is that the professed bond of love is absent
from our life. And here again God’s Word shows us
that a real living in expectancy of our Lord’s return
would teach us to love one another. In that same epistle
I have just quoted, Paul says, ‘The Lord make you to
increase and abound in love one toward another, and
toward all men, even as we do toward you: to the end
He may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness
before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord
with all His saints.’</p>

<p>“I have only time, this afternoon, for but one more
of these references, and that is a very elementary though
a very essential one. Paul, in that same epistle, teaches
that to be saved means that we are saved to serve. ‘Ye<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
turned to God,’ he says, ‘to serve ... and to wait for
His Son from heaven.’</p>

<p>“I must close, friends. But before I do, do let me
beseech every Christian here this afternoon to go aside
with God, and with His plain, unadulterated Word.
Assure yourself that Jesus is coming again, that He is
coming soon, and that you are so living that you shall
‘not be ashamed at His coming.’ Should He tarry till
Thursday next, and He is willing to suffer me to meet
you here again, we will continue this great subject on
the line of the three judgments. Let us close our meeting
by singing hymn number 308.”</p>

<p>Like one in a strange, delicious dream, Tom Hammond
rose with the others and sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Jesus is coming! Sing the glad word!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Coming for those He redeemed by His blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Coming to reign as the glorified Lord!</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Jesus is coming again!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As he left the hall, and thought, “How Zillah would
have enjoyed, how she would have been helped, by this
meeting!” he muttered.</p>

<p>“How senseless of me not to have told her of it when
I wrote this morning.”</p>

<p>He smiled a little to himself as he murmured:</p>

<p>“May I take this bit of remissness as a sign that the
Divine love was predominant within me, rather than the
human? Or was it that I am not yet sufficiently taught
in the school of human love?”</p>

<span class="smaller">“MY MENTOR.”</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was about the hour that Tom Hammond entered
the Hall to listen to the Major’s second address.
Cohen, the Jew, was in his workshop, his brain busy with
many problems, while his hands wrought out that wondrous
Temple work.</p>

<p>The door opened, quietly, and Zillah entered. She
often came for a talk with him at this hour, as she was
mostly sure of an uninterrupted conversation. Her sister,
to a large extent, lived to eat, and always slept for a
couple hours or more after her hearty two o’clock dinner.</p>

<p>The young Jew gave the beautiful girl a pleasant
greeting. Then, after the exchange of a few very general
words, the pair were silent. Zillah broke the silence
at last.</p>

<p>“Abraham,” she began, “I want to talk to you on—on—well—I’ve
something important to say.”</p>

<p>He eyed her curiously, a tender little smile moving
about among the lines of his mouth. There was a new
note in her voice, a new light in her eyes. He had
caught glimpses of both when they had met at breakfast,
and again at dinner, but both were more marked than
ever now.</p>

<p>He had laid down his tool at her first word of address.
Now she laid one of her pretty plump hands on his, as
she went on:——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>“You could not have been kinder, truer, dear Abraham,
if you had been my own brother, <i>after the flesh</i>.
I have looked upon you <i>as</i> a brother, as a friend, as a
protector, and I have always felt that I could, and would
make a confidant of you, should the needs-be ever arise.”</p>

<p>The gentle smile in his eyes as well as his mouth
encouraged her, and she went on:—</p>

<p>“A gentleman has asked me to marry him, Abraham——”</p>

<p>Cohen gave a quick little start, but in her eagerness
she did not notice it.</p>

<p>“I have promised,” she continued, “for I love him, and
he loves me as only——”</p>

<p>“Who is he, Zillah?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hammond, dear!”</p>

<p>His eyes flashed with the mildest surprise. But, to
her astonishment, she noticed that he showed no anger.</p>

<p>In spite of all his usual gentleness she had half
expected a little outburst, for to marry <i>out</i> of the Jewish
faith, was equal in shame almost to turning Meshumed,
and usually brought down the curse of one’s nearest and
dearest.</p>

<p>“He is of the Gentile race, Zillah!” Cohen said quietly.</p>

<p>She noticed that he said <i>race</i>, and not <i>faith</i>, and she
unconsciously took courage from the fact.</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment. Her lips moved slightly,
but no sound came from her. Watching her, he wondered.
She was praying!</p>

<p>Suddenly she lifted her head, proudly almost. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
suffered her great lustrous eyes,—liquid in their love-light—to
meet his, as she said, with a ringing frankness:——</p>

<p>“Abraham! I have found the Messiah! He whom the
Gentiles call the Christ; The man-God, Jesus, <i>is</i> the
Messiah!”</p>

<p>His eyes dwelt fixedly upon her face. She wondered
that there was neither anger nor indignation in them.</p>

<p>“May I tell you why I think, why I <i>know</i> He is the
Messiah, Abraham?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Do, Zillah!”</p>

<p>He spoke very gently, and she wondered more and
more. She made no remark, however, on his toleration,
but began to pour out her soul in the words of the Old
Testament scriptures, connecting them with their fulfillment
in the New Testament.</p>

<p>Cohen, watching her, thought of Deborah, for all her
beautiful form seemed suddenly ennobled under the
power of the theme that fired her.</p>

<p>“Now I know, dear Abraham,” she presently cried,
“How it is that Jehovah is allowing our Rabbis—you
told me, you know, the other day, of the one at Safed—to
be led to dates that prove that Messiah is coming
soon? <i>Now</i> I know why God has allowed our nation
to be stirred up,—the Zionist movement, the colonization
of Jerusalem and its neighbourhood, and all else of this
like—yes, it is because the Christ <i>is</i> coming.</p>

<p>“Only, dear brother, it is not as the Messiah of the
Jews that He comes soon—He came thus more than
1,900 years ago—this time, when He comes, He will
come for His church, His redeemed ones—Jew and Gentile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
alike who are washed in His blood that was shed
on Calvary for all the human race. For He was surely
<i>God’s</i> Lamb, and was slain at the Great, the last real
Passover, dear Abraham, if only we all—our race—could
see this. What the blood of that first Passover lamb, in
Egypt, was in type, to our people in their bondage and
Blood-deliverance, so Jesus was in reality.”</p>

<p>Moses, of old, wist not how his face shone. And
this lovely Jewish maiden, as she talked of her Lord,
wist not how all her lovely face was transformed as she
talked—<i>glorified</i> would not be too strong a description of
the change her theme had wrought in her countenance.</p>

<p>“And now, dear Abraham,” she went on, “that same
Jesus has not only blotted out all my sin, for His name’s
sake, but he bids me look for Him to come again. When
<i>next</i> He comes—it may be before even this day closes—”</p>

<p>Cohen shot a quick, puzzled glance at her. She did
not notice it but went on:—</p>

<p>“I have learned many things from the scriptures since
I have been going to the little Room at Spitalfields, and
from the <i>Word</i> of Jehovah, Himself, I have learned that
Jesus may now come at any moment.</p>

<p>“He will come <i>in the air</i>, and will catch away all His
believing children. Then, as the teachers show from
the <i>Word</i> of God, when the church is gone, there shall
arise a terrible power, a man who will be Satan’s great
agent to lead the whole world astray—<i>Anti</i>christ, the
Word of God calls him—then, during a period, probably
about seven years altogether, there shall be an ever
growing persecution of those who shall witness boldly
for Jesus, and—”</p>

<p>“<i>Who</i> will <i>they</i> be, Zillah,” he interrupted, “if all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
‘Church,’ as you say, will be taken out of the world at
the coming of Christ?”</p>

<p>“One of the teachers, the other night, Abraham,” she
replied, said, “that the natural consequence of the sudden
taking away of the Believers from this earth would
probably be, at first, a mighty revival, a turning to God.
If this be so, then these converts will be the witnesses
to Jesus during the awful seven years, which the Word
of God calls The Great Tribulation.”</p>

<p>“Then too, one of the teachers at the Room said, ‘it
is possible that not all Christians will be caught up in
the air at the coming again of Jesus, but <i>only</i> those
faithful ones who are found watching, expecting His
coming. If that be so—and no one dare dogmatise
about so sacred and solemn a thing—then there will be
thousands of Christians left behind who will have to pass
through the awful time of Antichrist’s Tribulation.’”</p>

<p>Her face glowed with holy light, as inspired by the
thought in her soul, she went on:—</p>

<p>“At first, dear Abraham, our own race will return
to Jerusalem, and to all the land of our Father, still
believing in the coming of the Messiah. The temple—that
wondrous Temple for which you are working—will
be reared to Jehovah. The morning and evening
sacrifices will be resumed. Then presently the Antichrist
will make our people believe that he is the Messiah.
Pretending to be Israel’s friend and protector he will
deceive them at first, but, by and by, he will try to force
idolatry upon them, he will want to set up in our glorious
Temple, (which will have been reared to Jehovah,)
an idol, an abomination.</p>

<p>“The teacher whom I have heard, Abraham,—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
many of them are of our own race—see from scripture
that the great mass of our people, in the land of our
fathers, will blindly accept this hideous idol worship.</p>

<p>“But Jehovah will not let Antichrist have all his own
way. Jesus, with all those who were caught up with
Him into the air, will come to the deliverance of our
people. He will come, <i>this</i> time, to the earth. He will
fight against Antichrist, will overcome him, His feet
shall stand on the Mount of Olives.</p>

<p>“Our poor deluded, suffering people will see Him,
as our own prophets have said:—“<i>I will pour out upon
the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
the spirit of grace and of supplication, <span class="smcap">and they
shall look upon Me whom they have pierced, and
they shall mourn for Him</span>, as one mourneth for his
only son, and shall be in bitterness for Him, as one that
is in bitterness for his first-born</i>.”</p>

<p>She paused abruptly, struck by Cohen’s quietude of
manner, where she had expected a storm. Gazing up
wonderingly into his face she cried:—</p>

<p>“Abraham, why are you thus quiet? Why have you
not cursed me for a Meshumed, dear? Can it be that
you, too, know aught of these glorious truths?”</p>

<p>There was sadness and kindness in his eyes as he
returned her pleading glance. But there was no trace
of anger.</p>

<p>“I wonder why, little sister,” he began, “I am not
angry, as the men of Israel’s faith usually are with a
Meshumed, even though the defaulter should be as beautiful
as Zillah Robart?”</p>

<p>His glance grew kinder, as he went on:—“I began to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
wonder where my little sister went, twice a week, in
the evenings, and, anxious about her, lest she, in her
innocence of heart and ignorance of life, should get into
trouble, I followed her one night, and saw that she
entered a hall, which I knew to be a preaching-place for
Jews.”</p>

<p>Zillah’s eyes were very wide with wonder. But she
did not interrupt him.</p>

<p>“I did not enter the place myself,” he went on, “but
that very first night, while waiting about for a few minutes,
I met an old friend, a Jew like myself, by <i>race</i>,
but a Christian by faith. He talked with me, pointed to
<i>our</i> scriptures, quoted from the Gentile New Testament,
showed, from them, how, in every detail, the birth, the
life, the death of Jesus, the Nazarene, fulfilled the
prophecies of our father, and——”</p>

<p>“And you, Abraham—” Zillah laid her hand on the
Jew’s wrist, in a swift gesture of excitement, “you, dear,”
she cried, “see that Jesus was the Messiah?”</p>

<p>Slowly, almost sorrowfully it seemed to the eager girl,
he shook his head.</p>

<p>“I cannot say all that, Zillah,” he went on, “I sat in
a seat, last night, in that Hall, where I could see you
and Hammond, where I could hear all that was said
upon the platform, but where I knew that neither you
nor Hammond would be able to see me. All that I
heard, last night, dear, has more than half convinced me,
but—well, I cannot rush through this matter, I have to
remember that it has to do with the life beyond, as well
as this life.”</p>

<p>He sighed a little wearily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>“I saw the meeting between Hammond and you,
Zillah,” he went on. “I had before begun to scent something
of Hammond’s probable feeling for you, and I had
seen you look at him in a way that, though you did not
yourself probably realize it, meant, I knew, a growing
feeling for him warmer than our maidens usually bestow
on a Gentile. I saw you enter the cab together, and
drive off, and——”</p>

<p>He sighed again. Then without finishing his sentence,
he said:</p>

<p>“Perhaps I shall see with you, Zillah, soon. Meanwhile,
dear——”</p>

<p>He lifted his hands, let them rest upon her head, and
softly, reverently, cried:—</p>

<p>“The Lord bless thee and keep thee; the Lord make
his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; the
Lord lift up His countenance upon thee, and give thee
peace.”</p>

<p>The sweet old Nazarite blessing never fell more tenderly
upon human ears than it did upon Zillah Robart.
Jehovah <i>had</i> been very gracious to her. She had feared
anger, indignation from her brother-in-law, she received
blessing instead.</p>

<p>As he slowly lifted his hands from her head, she caught
them in hers, lifted them to her lips, and kissed them
gratefully.</p>

<p>“May that blessing fall back upon your own head, upon
your heart, your life, dear Abraham?” she cried.</p>

<p>Still holding his hands, she lifted her head. An eager
light filled all her face, as she added:—</p>

<p>“It wants but a few days to Passover, dear, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
pray God that He will reveal Jesus fully to you before
that!”</p>

<p>She dropped his hands, and made for the door. “I
hear the children from school,” she cried. Then she
was gone.</p>

<p>Cohen did not turn to his work. But taking a New
Testament from his pocket, began to study anew the
Passion of Jesus, as recorded in the Gospels.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PLACARD.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Riding</span> back to his office from that meeting Tom
Hammond asked himself:—“Ought I to begin to
make this near Return of our Lord for His church, the
subject of my ‘Prophet’s Chamber Column’ for to-morrow’s
issue?”</p>

<p>“I must seek special guidance about this,” he presently
decided.</p>

<p>The cab was nearing the office when he suddenly murmured:—“<span class="smcap">He</span>
might come <i>to-day</i>!”</p>

<p>Even as he murmured the words his eyes seemed to
see a striking way of exhibiting his new-found faith in
the Return of his Lord, and he came to a rapid decision.</p>

<p>Lifting the flap in the roof of the cab, he told the
driver to go on to a certain Sign and Ticket writer’s.
Arrived at the place, he explained to the writer that
he wanted a card three feet six inches long, proportionate
in width, very <i>boldly</i>, handsomely written with just the
two words upon it, in the order of his sketch.</p>

<p>He had taken an odd piece of card from the man’s
scrap heap, and with his pencil he drew out his idea,
thus:—</p>

<div class="box">
<p class="center larger">TO-DAY?<br />
PERHAPS!</p>
</div>

<p>“How soon can I have it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“In a couple of hours, sir!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“Pack it carefully and I will send a messenger for
it!”</p>

<p>Hammond was turning from the counter, when the
man said:—</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir, but if it is not too bold a
question, may I ask what the two words mean?”</p>

<p>“They mean,” smiled Tom Hammond, “that Jesus
Christ, God’s son, may come suddenly to-day, before even
you have time to finish the work upon my order!”</p>

<p>The man’s face wore a puzzled look. Then suddenly
it brightened a little, as he said:—</p>

<p>“Ah! I sees, its somethink religious. That aint in my
line, not a bit, sir. I aint built that way. Now, my
misses is! She’s the best wife a man ever had, I can’t
find a speck o’ fault wi’ her, but, there it is, yer know,
she’s gone, fair gone, sir, on religious things!”</p>

<p>“Do you love her? Would you like to lose her?”
asked Hammond.</p>

<p>“Like to lose her, sir? why, no, sir! I believes I
should—I should—well I don’t know what I should do,
if she wur took!”</p>

<p>There was a note of deep gravity in Tom Hammond’s
voice, as he said:—</p>

<p>“Then let that motto warn you, as you prepare to
write it, that even before you can finish it, the Christ who
is to come again, who <i>will</i> surely come now very soon,
may come. Then, when you go to look for your wife,
when you are perhaps expecting her to call you to your
tea, she will be missing. You will call her, search for
her, yet never find her. Because, if she is a true child
of God, she, with all <i>true</i> Christians, will have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
snatched away unseen from the world, caught up to meet
their Lord in the air.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious, sir! yer give me the creeps!” gasped
the man.</p>

<p>“‘Seek ye the Lord’—your good wife’s Lord,—‘while
He may be found,’ my friend.” With this parting word
Tom Hammond left the shop.</p>

<p>Two hours and a half later the splendid bit of sign
writing hung upon the wall of Hammond’s room.</p>

<p>It was a most striking placard. The first letter of
each word nearly eight inches in length, and in brilliant
crimson, the other letters six inches long in deep, purple
black.</p>

<p>As he sat back and regarded it where it hung, Tom
Hammond mused on all that he had heard that afternoon,
of the effects upon the lives of those who possessed
a real heart apprehension of the truth of the near Return
of the Lord.</p>

<p>“One can scarcely conceive,” he murmured, “what
London, what all the civilized, and so-called Christian
world, would be like, if every man and woman, who
<i>professes</i> to be a christian, lived in the light of the truth
that the Lord’s return was near, was imminent. ‘Every
man’ (he was recalling the truth quoted that afternoon),
‘<i>Who hath this Hope in him, purifieth himself even as
He (Jesus) is pure.</i>’”</p>

<p>The rest of the day was a busy one. Many callers
came in. Everyone noticed the strange placard. Some
asked what it meant. Modestly, but with strong purpose,
and with perfect frankness, Hammond told each and all
who enquired, of his change of heart, and how possessed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
with the fact that Christ’s return was imminent, he had
had the placard done for his own, and for others quickening
and reminder.</p>

<p>People smiled indulgently, but entered into no argument
with him. He was too important a man for that, and,
equally, they dare not <i>pooh-pooh</i> his testimony, wild as
it appeared to most, if not all of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="smaller">WAS HE MAD?</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Madge</span>, a wife of barely eighteen hours, found her
husband’s church packed in every nook and corner
when she entered it on the Sunday morning.</p>

<p>The news of her sudden return, and equally sudden
marriage, had helped to fill the church, though the knowledge
that the Rev. Doig was to preach would, in itself,
have been sufficient to have gathered an unusually large
congregation.</p>

<p>During the pastor’s sickness the pulpit had been supplied
by various good men, secured by the deacons from
all over the county. Doig had preached twice before,
and was already a great favourite with the people.</p>

<p>The pastor had not been well enough to be present
at any service for many weeks, and as he entered the
church this morning, leaning heavily upon his wife’s
arm, he received quite an ovation from the people.</p>

<p>In spite of the curiosity and excitement over Madge’s
appearance, the congregation speedily settled down to
quiet worship. There was something subducing, quieting
in the preacher’s manner. Just before the address, the
people sang:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lo! God is here! let us adore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And own how dreadful is this place!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let all within us feel His power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And silent bow before His face;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who know His power, His grace who prove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Serve Him with awe, with reverence, love.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With the singing of this hymn a deep, deep solemnity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
came down upon the assembly. It deepened as the
preacher unfolded the wonders of the Bible revelation
relating to the Lord’s second coming.</p>

<p>Madge forgot her husband, as, absorbed by the wonder
of the revelation, she drank in the glorious truth. Had
she been more alert in watching the pastor, she would
have seen how restless he grew! How angrily his eyes
flashed! How scowling his beetling brows became.</p>

<p>Some of the people noticed their pastor’s evident displeasure,
and so did one or two of the deacons. But no
one dreamed that he would dare to utter any dissent to
the service.</p>

<p>Was he mad? Perhaps he was, for the time, as many
men and women become, who nurse a groundless, senseless
anger and jealousy! He was jealous of this man’s
hold upon the people. He had not dreamed that any
man could hold his congregation, as this man was holding
them. He was angry, too, at the doctrine preached.</p>

<p>With a startling suddenness he leaped to his feet,
forgetting his weakness, as he cried:—</p>

<p>“I will not have that lying, senseless nonsense—worse
than nonsense—preached in <i>my</i> church, Mr. Doig. You
will either announce another text, and take a different
subject, sir, or you must cease to preach!”</p>

<p>A slight flush rose into the cheeks of the preacher, as
he half turned to the pastor, and in low, but firm voice,
heard everywhere amid the sudden strained silence, he
said:—</p>

<p>“Dear Pastor, if you insist, (you have the <i>legal</i> right
to do so, as <i>pastor</i> of this church, I suppose) I will
desist. But I cannot, if I preach on, do other than
declare all that God would have me do. Why, even as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
we are here, our Loving Lord may come, and if I faltered
in my testimony I should have to meet Him ashamedly—and—”</p>

<p>“Rot!” muttered the pastor. The word was heard by
everyone, and a murmur of strong dissent ran through
the place.</p>

<p>With a white angry face, and flashing savage eyes,
the Pastor walked to the table, and leant upon it heavily
in his weakness, as he cried hoarsely, “This service is
now concluded. While I hold the pastorate, no such
sentimental rubbish, as Mr. Doig seems bent upon giving
us, shall be voiced from this platform.”</p>

<p>One of the deacons protested. The pastor was firm.
Passion had rendered him temporarily irresponsible.
Another of the deacons, who had been conferring with
Doig—who had whispered the facts of the pastor’s evident
temporary irresponsibility—now urged the people to
disperse quietly.</p>

<p>Doig walked down to his host, and whispered, “if I
go at once, it will help matters.” The pair then left the
church. The congregation followed quickly. The deacons
remained behind to confer together over the situation,
which was of a hitherto unheard of character.</p>

<p class="tb">The pastor had left by the side door, and leaning more
heavily than ever upon Madge, they made their way to
the house of Thaddeus Finisterre, Madge’s father. They
were staying there. They took a private way, by which
they were spared the unpleasantness of meeting any of
the congregation.</p>

<p>Four minutes took them to the house. Neither of
them spoke during the brief journey. For the first time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
in her life Madge knew what it was to feel the touch
of fear. She had married the man by her side knowing
comparatively little of his real character and temperament.</p>

<p>“There may be insanity in his family,” she mused, as
she walked by his side. She had already told herself
that nothing but a temporary touch of madness could
have led to his outburst in the church.</p>

<p>Arrived at the house, the pastor went straight to his
room, this gave Madge an opportunity to confer with her
father and mother a moment.</p>

<p>“His long anxious illness has unsettled his brain a
little!” the mother said. “The best thing will be to take
no notice, let us all be as cheerful, as much like our
ordinary selves, as we can. Then, if we can persuade
him to go away to-morrow, I guess the best thing for you
to do, Madge, will be to get a good doctor to examine
him, and to prescribe for him.”</p>

<p>The dinner-meal which followed, presently, was fairly
free of constraint. After dinner Mr. and Mrs. Finisterre
slipped away and left the husband and wife to themselves.</p>

<p>Almost immediately the pair were left, the pastor began
to abuse the preacher of the morning, and to denounce
the teaching of the Lord’s second coming.</p>

<p>“But, my dear,” cried Madge, “it is evidently almost
the most prominent doctrine in the New Testament.
There are more direct references to it in the New Testament,
Mr. Doig said, than to any other revealed doctrine.”</p>

<p>“But its not <i>my</i> doctrine,” snapped the pastor, “not
the doctrine of <i>our</i> church. It was scoffed at at our college,
when <i>I</i> was a student, and—and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>Madge gazed wonderingly at him. His argument
seemed so puerile, if not actually sinful.</p>

<p>“But,” she cried, “I don’t see how that argument
holds. To me, it sounds like blasphemy, almost, to say
<i>I</i>, as a <i>minister</i>, and <i>we</i> as a <i>church</i>, will not preach the
most prominent doctrine of the New Testament, because
of the foolish abuse of the teaching by here and there a
wild visionary who lets his fancy and whim run away with
his judgment. Suppose, dear Homer, some church or
minister should say, ‘We won’t preach the doctrine of the
Atonement,’ would that save them from the charge of
blasphemy, when God says:</p>

<p>“‘If any man shall take away from the words of the
book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out
of the Book of Life, and out of the Holy City, and from
the things which are written in his Book.’”</p>

<p>The pastor gazed at her in amazement. Her fashion
of putting the matter gave him small opportunity of
replying, so he took refuge in the coarse sneer:—</p>

<p>“Have you turned <i>Doigite</i>?”</p>

<p>With a quick flush in her cheeks, and sudden flashing
of eye, Madge replied:—</p>

<p>“If by that you mean, do I see, and have I accepted
the revelation of the Word of God, as to the near coming
of Christ, then I say ‘<i>yes</i>.’ I am <i>not</i> a Doigite, but I am,
thank God, a Christian! A very young one, a very poor
and inexperienced one, ’tis true, but still I am one, and
am desirous to live to the Lord to whom I have given
myself, and, after all I heard from the preacher this
morning, I am more than ever determined to serve Christ
wholly, and I can quite see how this wondrous <i>fact</i> of the
near Return of our Lord will be a new and mighty force
to revolutionize all my life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>An ugly snarl curled the lips of the amazed, discomfited
pastor, and he was just beginning a cruel little
speech, when one of the Deacons was announced.</p>

<p>Madge left the two men alone. As she passed on to
her own room there was a terrible pain at her heart, for
the hideous thought came to her:—“Can Homer be truly
converted? If he is, how can it be that he flatly refuses
to believe what God has so plainly revealed?”</p>

<span class="smaller">FROM THE PROPHET’S CHAMBER.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Tom Hammond</span> was alone in his editorial office.
He had come to the day, the moment at last, when
he felt constrained to write out of his full heart, to the
readers of his paper, all that he yearned that the world
should know of the imminence of the Return of the
Lord.</p>

<p>Before he put pen to paper to write on this supreme
theme in his “Prophet’s Chamber” column, he bowed
his head on his desk and prayed for guidance and help.
Then he began to write out his heart fully, telling first
of his conversion, and of the wondrous meetings conducted
by Major H——.</p>

<p>His whole being was fired with holy purpose. “Had
ever a preacher such a pulpit as has the editor of “The
Courier?” he wrote. “Had any preacher ever so mighty
a privilege, so great a responsibility as is mine to-day?
This paper circulates through more than a million people’s
hands, even allowing that only the one person purchasing
the paper, reads it—though one might almost safely
double that million, since there are very few of the
papers which will not be read by <i>two</i>, or more persons.</p>

<p>“This ‘Prophet’s Column’ will likely overflow all its
ordinary banks, as does the Great Nile in its season,
but if my overflowing but carry life on its tide, as does
the tide of the overflowing Nile, then, all will be well.</p>

<p>“As a converted Editor of a great daily, I have put
my hand, my pen, my mind into the mighty, unerring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
hand of God, praying that I may write only that which
will reach the <i>hearts</i> of my readers. And the question
comes to me, ‘what word does London, does England
most need to-day?’</p>

<p>“This—that all the world should know, and realize,
that any day, aye, any hour, Christ may return—not
to the earth but <i>into the air</i>—”</p>

<p>Here followed the teaching of the Gospel and Epistles,
as he had learned it from Major H——, and from his
own subsequent personal study of the Word of God.</p>

<p>“I appeal to the most thoughtful of my readers, I
appeal to the unthinking, as I say, ‘do you not see how
a real belief, in this near coming of Christ would revolutionize
all our national, commercial, domestic, and church
life. How, too, it would immediately settle every social
problem.’</p>

<p>“If our legislators, sitting in council at St. Stephens,
realized that before the present Parliamentary session
could end in the ordinary way, that Christ might come,
what a speedy end they would seek to put to every
national iniquity.</p>

<p>“The hideous drink traffic would be swept, root and
branch, from our land. And, in sweeping that curse
away, the awful problem of the unemployed, the homeless,
the starving, all that inures to our national poverty
would be swept away.</p>

<p>“The shameful opium traffic with China; the national
Greed for territory; the Traffic in White Slaves; and
every other national iniquity would be abolished.</p>

<p>“Christian churches, (so-called) would become worthy
of the name <i>Christian</i>. All those bits of devilish device
used to extract, and extort money from the pockets
of the people would end, as by magic. Theatricals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
would be left to the theatres; nigger entertainments
would be left to the music-halls; the church would leave
all these things to their master—<i>the Devil</i>.</p>

<p>“In <i>social</i> life, people would pay their debts; the wild,
mad, sinful extravagance that marks the life of to-day,
would cease. Christians would love one another. Every
Evangelical denomination would be <i>inter</i>-denominational
in the truest sense, and be <i>one</i> wholly in their Crucified,
Risen, coming Lord. A love for the poor fallen world,
such as has never been since our Lord spent Himself in
service, would be the order of the day, and not the
vision of a few. Every missionary society would have
more men and women and money than they actually
needed.</p>

<p>“But, even as I pen this millennium-like picture, I know,
from the Word of God, that it <i>cannot</i> be <i>before</i> Christ
comes. But I seek to arouse every <i>Christian</i> to God’s
call to them on this matter. You, who profess to be
Christ’s, dare not refuse this truth, save at the peril of
losing the <i>Crown</i> of Life.</p>

<p>“The vast bulk of the churches, I know, preach, that
the world will continually improve until the earth shall
be fit for Christ to come and reign. But I defy any
cleric or layman to show me a single word of scripture
that gives the faintest colour to that belief, or statement—unless
the person wrests the passage so advanced from
its distinctly marked <i>dispensational</i> setting.</p>

<p>“Things (spiritual) are growing worse and worse.
There is a wholesale down-gradeism, too awful to contemplate.
‘Priest and people have erred alike!’ I take
up the official organ of a section of the church that has
ever been regarded as the most out-an-out, in all that
pertains to Evangelical truth, and I find its great head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
saying ‘The Bible is <i>not</i> the sole spiritual guide for the
christian, for, practically, the Bible is a <i>dead</i> book!’</p>

<p>“The chief leader-writer of that same paper—himself
usually regarded as the soundest of Believers, the most
trenchant of all Evangelical preachers, writes in one of
a series of articles, ‘That the so-called <i>Finished work</i>
of Christ, is a doctrine not to be found in scripture,’
and glories in the fact that ‘<i>we</i> never have, and, I trust,
we never shall, preach this doctrine.’</p>

<p>“All this but proves the truth of the New Testament
prophecies, ‘<i>Perilous</i> times shall come,’ ‘Evil men and
seducers shall wax worse and worse, <i>deceiving</i>, and <i>being
deceived</i>.’ If only we could all be induced to read the
signs of the times in the light of scripture! we should
then realize that we were in the thickest darkness of
the world’s blackest night, the darkness immediately preceding
the dawn, and we should be looking for ‘the
Morning Star.’”</p>

<p>Here, writing with swift, eager pen, he went over
the ground covered by Major H——, as regarded the
signs of the coming of the Lord—the movement among
the Jews; their excitement, as a race, over the date
discovery 5,666; the preparations for the rebuilding of
the Temple. Then the increased effort in the Foreign
Mission fields. The growth of the spirit of lawlessness
in the world, and in the church. The multiplicity of
spiritualistic devices—<i>doctrine of Devils</i>. The awakening
of all real, true, spiritually-minded Bible <i>students</i>
to the fact of Christ’s near Return. And the great,
but often disregarded sign, “the scoffers who shall say
where is the promise of His coming? for, since the
Fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were
from the beginning of creation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>“But He <i>will</i> come! He is near at hand! Every sign
of the times proclaims this! It is <span class="smcap">night</span>, now, and He
will come as a thief in the night. At any moment now
we may look for Him. Before this news-sheet, damp
from the press, is in the hands of my readers, Christ
<i>may</i> have come and taken away <i>every one</i> of His own
Believing people—<i>I</i> shall be missing, another here, and
another there will be missing.</p>

<p>“And when a puzzled, troubled London shall be gathering
in business, that saying shall have come to pass,
‘<i>The one shall be taken, the other left!</i>’ (For though
this word is <i>primarily Jewish</i> in its application, it will
yet have a measure of meaning for the world, when the
Church is taken away).</p>

<p>“May every <i>Christian</i> be ready to meet His Lord,
when He shall come, and every unready, unsaved soul
who reads these ‘Prophet’s Chamber’ columns, seek the
face of God through faith in the Atoning work of Jesus
Christ. For, believe me, His Return is very near, to
some of us the sound of His footfalls is even now in our
ears.”</p>

<p>He bent his head over the written sheets, praying God
to bless the message. Then an interruption came. A
knock at the door, and his sub, Ralph Bastin entered.</p>

<span class="smaller">PASSOVER!</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Cohen</span>, the Jew, blew out the candle, and set the
stand aside. The knees of his trousers were pressed
and dusty. He had just been over the whole house,
lighted candle in hand, and had searched every nook
and crannie, every cupboard, every shelf, under the edge
of every carpet, looking for the faintest sign of leaven
in the form of bread, cake, or biscuit crumb. He had
found nothing, and went to his room to bathe and change
his clothing.</p>

<p>“What of you, Zillah?” he had asked the lovely girl,
earlier in the day. “With your newly-espoused faith
in the Nazarene, shall you partake of the lamb with us?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, I will,” she replied, “<i>only</i> I shall take the
meal more in the spirit of the Lord’s Supper, of the
Christian Church. And Abraham——”</p>

<p>Her eyes, as they were lifted to his, swam with tender,
pitying tears, as she added:</p>

<p>“All the time I shall be praying that you may meet
the Christ of God, Jesus of Nazareth; and while you
seek to remember our people’s deliverance from the land
of Bondage, I shall be praying that you, dear Abram,
may be delivered from the bondage of the legalism of
our race.”</p>

<p class="tb">The Passover table was spread in Cohen’s house. The
arrangement of that table was a curious mixture of
Mosaic and Rabbinical command. In the case of all but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
really very pious Jews of this day, the real and actual
Passover is not kept.</p>

<p>Passover—(<i>chag Appesach</i> of the Jews) <i>must</i> have
a lamb roasted to make it the <i>real</i> feast, the ordinary
Jew to-day, contents himself with an egg, and a burnt
shank-bone of mutton, and unleavened cakes.</p>

<p>Cohen’s Passover Feast always included a small lamb.
Still, Rabbinical lore and Bible command were curiously
mixed in the Cohen celebration.</p>

<p>The table, to-night, had an egg according to Rabbinical
order, but there was a tiny roast lamb as well. There
was the glass dish of bitter herbs; the salt water, typifying
the tears of Israelitish misery in Egypt; a dish of
almonds, apples, and other fruit, chopped and mixed,
represented the lime and mortar of the Brick-making in
the Land of Bondage.</p>

<p>Chervil and parsley were there, and lettuce. A large
pile of unleavened cakes, a big coloured glass ewer with
unfermented wine and water, and many other items
considered to be the orthodox thing at the Feast.</p>

<p>All the Cohen household was there. Zillah, radiant
with the glow of the new life in Christ that had come to
her.</p>

<p>Rachel, her sister, was red-eyed and sullen. Zillah
had been pleading with her to open her mind, and her
heart to the Christian teaching of the Messiah who had
come, and who had atoned for <i>all</i> the race, Jew and
Gentile alike.</p>

<p>Angry and sullen, the wife had said hard things of
Zillah. Her frivolous, irresponsible nature was more
than satisfied with the barest <i>form</i> of the faith of her
race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>The two children were full of suppressed excitement,
the elder—the boy—especially.</p>

<p>Cohen, the head of the house, was singularly quiet
and grave. His eyes had a far-away look in them. He
looked like a man moving in a trance.</p>

<p>Presently the boy, (he had been carefully coached)
asked, according to the usual formula:</p>

<p>“What mean ye, father, by this Service?”</p>

<p>Cohen’s eyes stared over the head of his son, and in
a voice very unlike its usual tones, replied:—</p>

<p>“<i>It is the Sacrifice of Jehovah’s Passover, who halted
by the blood-sprinkled houses of our fathers in Egypt,
that the destroying angel should come not nigh, when
He smote the Egyptians, but preserved our fathers.</i>”</p>

<p>“Will our people <i>ever</i> do this, father?” queried the
boy.</p>

<p>“Till Messiah come, they will, dear son.” The strained
gaze of Cohen, as he answered, was as though he was
trying to pierce Time’s veil, and see the coming Messiah
approaching.</p>

<p>“<i>When</i> will Messiah come, father?” continued the boy.</p>

<p>“<i>To-night</i>, perhaps, my son. Set His chair! Open
the door!”</p>

<p>Swiftly, but with remarkable quietude, for a child,
the boy placed a chair at the table, then, stepping briskly,
silently to the door, he set it wide open, and left it thus,
and returned to his place by the table.</p>

<p>Rachel took the ewer and poured out a little wine and
water into each glass. In her sullenness, as she came
to Zillah’s glass, she slopped the wine over the edge.
The children glanced curiously from the spilled wine
to the face of their aunt, then at their father’s face.</p>

<p>Zillah’s face flushed; Cohen’s grew pale, and set in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
sharp spasm of pain. No word was said, each took up
their glass, and drank the <i>first</i> cup of blessing.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, then Cohen spread his
hands, bowed his head, and repeated “The Blessing:—”</p>

<p>“<i>The Lord bless us and keep us; the Lord make His
face shine upon us and be gracious unto us. The Lord
lift up the light of his countenance upon us and give us
peace.</i>”</p>

<p>Under her breath, yet distinctly heard by Cohen, in
the solemn hush that followed the Blessing, Zillah murmured:—</p>

<p>“<i>But now, in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were
afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</i> <span class="smcap">For
He is our Peace.</span>”</p>

<p>Cohen glanced quietly at her. She met the glance
with one of intense yearning. He translated it rightly,
as meaning “If <i>only</i> you could see this truth?”</p>

<p>There were two bowls of water set on a side-board.
Cohen and his wife rinsed their hands in one bowl, Zillah
and the two children in the other.</p>

<p>Addressing himself to his son, more than to the others,
Cohen, when they had returned to the table, as the head
of the house was instructed to do, explained why they
sat at the Feast:—</p>

<p>“Our Fathers, when they took the Feast for the <i>first</i>
time in Egypt, my son, took it <i>standing</i>, with their loins
girt, and their staff in hand, for <i>they</i> were starting on that
great journey that eventually lasted forty years. But
we, their descendants, eat the feast to-day, <i>sitting</i> at our
ease, as a symbol that our people have been delivered
from the cruel bondage.”</p>

<p>Then the <i>first</i> Hallel was repeated.—Psalms 113, and
114. The <i>second</i> cup of Blessing was taken by each.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
Then Cohen asked a Blessing on <i>each</i> kind of food on
the table. Then he carved a portion of lamb for each
one, they took their seats, and the meal began.</p>

<p>The children were excused from eating the stinging
bitter herbs. But Cohen, Rachel, and Zillah, each took a
little with their lamb and unleavened bread.</p>

<p>Conversation became fairly general over the meal,
except that Rachel’s sullen anger increased, and she kept
silent.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the meal, the <i>third</i> cup of Blessing
was drunk, and Cohen repeated the 115, 116, 117,
118, Psalm. At the close of the Hallel, the <i>fourth</i>, and
last cup of Blessing was taken. The Feast was over.</p>

<p>A sudden silence fell upon them all. No one moved,
no one spoke, for a moment. Suddenly Zillah broke
the dead silence. She had a glorious voice, and she let
it ring out in that wondrous song:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“Not all the blood of beasts</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">On Jewish altars slain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could give the guilty conscience peace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Or wash away our stain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No one interrupted. Cohen <i>could</i> not, for the thrall
of some strange, new power was upon him. His wife
was furious—but kept her fury bottled up. The children
were delighted, they loved to hear their aunt sing, and
to the amaze of their father and mother—they joined in
the singing, for, with other children, they had often
of late been to the evening meeting for Jewish children.
And Zillah, who had talked with them, believed that
they loved the Christ.</p>

<p>Without a break, the three voices sang on:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“But Christ the Heavenly Lamb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Takes all our sins away;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sacrifice of nobler name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And richer Blood than they.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“My faith would lay her hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">On that meek head of Thine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While as a penitent I stand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And here confess my sin.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“My soul looks back to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">The burden Thou didst bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When hanging on the accursed tree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And knows her guilt was there.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“Believing we rejoice</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">To feel the curse remove;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And trust His bleeding love.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again, for full thirty seconds, as the glorious song
finished, there was an absolute silence, save for the
ricketting of Rachel’s chair, as she moved in pettish
anger on her seat.</p>

<p>Zillah had kept her eyes fixed upon Cohen’s face all
the time she was singing, and had seen a strangely wondrous
light slowly gather in his eyes. She had known,
for days, that he was very, very near to the point of
acceptance of Christ. Even as they had gathered at the
table of the Passover, she was not sure, but that in all
but profession and testimony, he was a Christian.</p>

<p>Now he suddenly broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Sing the last two verses again, Zillah” he said.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“<i>My</i> soul looks back to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">The burden Thou didst bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When hanging on the accursed tree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And knows her guilt was there.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Zillah’s glorious voice rang out. And now, even to
<i>her</i> wonder, Cohen’s deeper tones joined hers. Her heart
leaped as she noted the emphasis he put upon the “<i>My</i>
soul.”</p>

<p>She sang on. His voice sang on too. Then came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
the last verse, and in a perfect burst of triumph, his
voice rang out:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">“Believing <i>I</i> rejoice</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">To feel the curse remove;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>I</i> bless the Lamb with cheerful voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And trust His bleeding love!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was a strangely ecstatic moment for Zillah. Tears
flooded her eyes, she tried to speak, but her emotion
choked her.</p>

<p>Cohen stood up. His face was ablaze with the wonder
of the revelation that had come to him. He spread his
hands upward, and his eyes were lifted in the same direction,
as he cried:—</p>

<p>“Thou loving Christ! Thou Precious Jesus! I am
<i>Thine</i>—<span class="smcap">thine</span>—THINE—!”</p>

<p>Then he remembered his wife.</p>

<p>“Rachael, dear heart,” he cried, as he moved to her side.
“Machael, wife of my heart. Jesus <i>is</i> the Messiah!”</p>

<p>“Bah!” she cried. With a thrust of her hand and foot,
she kept him from her. Then in tones of withering
scorn and disgust, she cried:</p>

<p>“Mehusmed!”</p>

<p>He bent over her very tenderly, stooping to meet her
eyes, and trying to take her hand.</p>

<p>The two children clung to Zillah, and the boy suddenly
began to pipe out, in his clear treble, the hymn so
beloved of Jewish children who attend the mission meetings.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come to the Saviour, Make no delay,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Rachael shot a fiercely angry glance in the boy’s direction,
then without looking at her husband, she thrust
at him, to prevent his taking her hand, as she cried:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>“Accursed! Mehusmed! Don’t touch <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“But, Rachael!” he began tenderly.</p>

<p>She flung herself sharply round upon him and spat
full in his face. Then she turned sharply from him
again.</p>

<p>A full half minute went by. The room grew so eerily
still that it startled her. She turned to gaze where the
quartette had been.</p>

<p>The room was empty save for herself!</p>

<p>With a cry she started to her feet. They could not
have gone out of the door for her chair had all the time
stood right in the way. What was this then that had
happened?</p>

<p>Her breath came hot and laboured. Her eye-balls
bulged horribly! A reeling sickness began to steal over
her. She dropped back, terrified, in her chair, gasping:—</p>

<p>“Zillah said this morning “The Christ will come <i>soon,
suddenly</i>, then those who are His, will be taken, unseen,
unheard, from the world!”</p>

<p>With a sharp, anguished cry, she let her bulging, terror-filled
eyes sweep the room again as she cried:—</p>

<p>“And my <i>children</i>, too!”</p>

<p>Her eyes were tearless, but dry, hard sobs shook all
her frame.</p>

<p>The next moment a kind of frenzy seized her. She
rushed to the front door, and into the street. She
would find out if any one else was missing.</p>

<p>A little crowd was on the pavement. A hansom cab
stood by the curb. The fare was standing on the front
board. He was a minister of some kind. He wore a
M.B. waistcoat, a clerical collar, a soft, wide-brimmed,
black felt hat. He glanced up at the driver’s seat, as he
cried:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>“But <i>some</i> one, <i>surely</i>, must have seen what became
of him. If he fell off his box in a fit, where is his
body?”</p>

<p>“I seed him one hinstant,” cried a voice from the
crowd, “I wur lookin straight at ’im, ’cos I sed to myself,
taint often as yer see a kebby wear a white ’at, now-a-days.
Then, while I wur starin’ at ’im, he sort o’ disappeared,
the reins fell on the roof o’ the keb, the ’oss
stopped, an—”</p>

<p>“He’s gone!” shrieked a woman’s voice.</p>

<p>It was Rachael. Bare-headed, dressed in all her festal
finery, she had just rushed down the steps of the house,
and heard the question and answer as to the disappearance
of the hansom driver. The crowd turned and faced
her, her shrill tones had startled them.</p>

<p>“He’s gone to Jehovah!” she screamed again. “My
husband, my sister, my two children—we were at Passover—we——”</p>

<p>With a piercing shriek she flung up her arms, laughed
hideously and fell in a huddled heap on the bottom step
of the flight.</p>

<span class="smaller">“THIS SAYING SHALL COME TO PASS.”</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Tom Hammond</span> greeted his <i>sub</i> most heartily.
Ralph had been away, in Paris, for a fortnight,
partly on business, partly for a change.</p>

<p>As soon as their greetings were exchanged, he turned
eagerly to Hammond, as he said:—</p>

<p>“But I say, old man, what on earth is all this jargon
you wrote me about, the return of the Christ, and——”</p>

<p>He paused suddenly. His eyes had just caught sight
of the great placard. His gaze was riveted on it. He
read the two words aloud:—</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">To-day? Perhaps!</span>”</p>

<p>In a voice of wondering amaze, he gasped:—</p>

<p>“What’s <i>that</i>, Tom? What <i>does</i> it mean?”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond repeated, in a few sentences, what
he had previously written to his friend, as to his conversion,
then, passing on to the subject of the Lord’s
second coming, he said:</p>

<p>“I am so impressed, Ralph, with the imminence of
our Lord’s return, that I have had that placard done
to arrest the attention of callers upon me, and give me
an opportunity of speaking to them about their eternal
destiny. To-day, too, I have been impressed so with
the necessity of speaking to the world—“The Courier’s”
world, I mean of course—on this great, this momentous
subject, that I have made it the subject of my ‘Prophet’s
Chamber’ column.”</p>

<p>He gathered up the sheets of his M.S. he had written,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
and passed them over the table to Ralph Bastin.</p>

<p>“You will see, I have written it in the most simple,
almost colloquial style, Ralph,” he said. “I wanted it
to be a man’s quiet, earnest, simple utterance to his fellow
man, and not a journalist’s article.”</p>

<p>Ralph Bastin’s eyes raced over the papers. His face
was a strange study, while he read, reflecting a score
of different, ever-changing emotions, but amid them all
never losing a constant deepening amaze.</p>

<p>As he finished the last sheet, he looked Tom Hammond
hard and searchingly in the face.</p>

<p>“My dear Tom,” he began. His voice was very grave,
very serious. “You’ll ruin The Courier! You will ruin
yourself! The world will call you mad——!”</p>

<p>“They called my Lord mad, Ralph, and they have called
His servants mad, over and over again, ever since.”</p>

<p>There was not a shadow of cant in his voice and
manner, as he went on:—</p>

<p>“The word of our God, Ralph—which is the <i>only real</i>
rule of life, tells us that Christ, whose name I profess,
said:—</p>

<p>“‘Whosoever shall confess me, before men, him will
I confess also before my Father which is in Heaven....
If any man will come after Me, <i>let him deny himself</i>,
and take up his cross <i>daily</i>, and follow Me. For whosoever
will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will
lose his life, for My sake, the same shall save it. For
what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world
and lose his own soul....</p>

<p>“‘For whosoever shall be ashamed of me <i>and of My
words</i>.’ (‘<i>Surely I come quickly</i>,’ Ralph, is one of <i>His
very last</i> recorded words,) ‘of him shall the Son of Man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
be ashamed, when He shall come in His own glory, and
in His Father’s, and of the holy angels.’”</p>

<p>Tom Hammond leant forward in his chair to lay his
hand on the wrist of the other, to plead with him. But,
with an exclamation of angry impatience, Ralph, cried:</p>

<p>“Hang it, old man, you must be going dotty!”</p>

<p>With an expression of annoyance, almost amounting
to disgust, he swung round on his heel.</p>

<p>“Look here, Tom,” he began.</p>

<p>He swirled back to meet his friend face to face.</p>

<p>Then, with a startled cry, he stared at the chair, in
which, an instant before, Tom Hammond had been sitting.</p>

<p>The chair was empty!</p>

<p>“Good God!” he gasped.</p>

<p>Instinctively he knew what had happened! Involuntarily
his eyes travelled to the Placard, and in the same
moment he recalled the closing words of Tom Hammond’s
M.S. which he had just read:—</p>

<p>“‘<i>Then shall it come to pass, that which is written</i>,
“<span class="smcap">One shall be taken, the other left.</span>’”</p>

<p>A strange, unnatural trembling seized him. He dropped
into the chair he had been occupying, and stared
at the empty revolving chair opposite.</p>

<p>“Good——God!” He slowly repeated the words.
There was no thought of irreverence in the utterance.
It was the unconscious acknowledgment of God’s Presence
and Power.</p>

<p>For a time—he never knew how long—he sat still
and silent like a man stunned. Then, as his eyes travelled
slowly to where the sheets of M.S.’s lay, he smiled wearily,
drew them towards him, and took his stylo from his
pocket. Putting the most powerful pressure of his will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
upon himself, he began to write after the last works penned
by his translated chief:—</p>

<p>“P.S.—Written by the sub-editor of “The Courier.”
By the time this printed sheet is being read, the world
will have learned that a section of the community has
been suddenly taken from our midst. The Editor of
The Courier, the giant mind and kindly heart of Tom
Hammond, have been taken from us.</p>

<p>“The writer of this postscript, who was in the room,
when the “Prophet” of The Courier was taken, was in
the act of scorning his message as to the nearing of the
great translation. “In a moment, in the twinkling of
an eye” he was gone.</p>

<p>“The writer has not left the room since, and has no
means of knowing who else among those known to him
are missing,—not many <i>personal</i> acquaintances, he fears,
since one’s personal clique has never shown any very
marked signs of what one has <i>hitherto</i> considered an
<i>ultra</i> type of Christianity, a condition of “<i>righteous overmuch</i>.”</p>

<p>“When we pass out of this room, presently, and touch
the great outside world once more, what shall we find?
How soon will it be generally known that a section of
the community—a larger section, maybe, than we conceive
possible—has been silently, suddenly, secretly taken
from our midst? What will follow? Where are the
prophets who shall teach us where we are, and what
we may expect? Does the end of the world follow
next? Is there any order of events, specified in the
Bible, that follows this mysterious translation, if so,
what is it? Who will show us these things?</p>

<p>“Again, since I, the writer of this postscript, am left,
while my friend, Hammond, is taken, <i>why am I left</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
why shall I find—as of course I shall when I begin to go
abroad among mine acquaintance—hundreds of others
<i>left</i>? I have been christened, confirmed, have occasionally
‘communicated,’—this is the clerical term, though as
I write, it occurs to me that there must have been some
flaw, somewhere, in the ‘<i>communicating</i>.’</p>

<p>“I have always supposed myself a Christian by virtue
of these things, to which a clean, decent life has been
added. Thousands upon thousands, I feel sure, will
be puzzled by this same contemplation, when this wonderful
Translation becomes generally known.</p>

<p>“If we are not made Christians by christening, confirmation,
communicating, why have we always been
taught so, by our clergy? How many of these same
clergy shall we find <i>left</i> behind.</p>

<p>“And I suppose there will have been some kind of
kindred process at work among the Nonconformists
bodies—in pulpit and pew, alike. For ourselves, we
have come little in contact with Nonconformity, but,
if what is accepted generally, to-day, as to the religious
situation, be true—that the curse of the Ritualism of the
‘Establishment,’ finds its parallel in the Rationalism, Unitarianism,
Socialism, etc., of Nonconformity—then I shall
expect to find as many Nonconformists, lay and ministerial,
<i>left</i> behind from this mysterious, spiritual translation,
as churchmen.”</p>

<p>There came a tap at the door. The messenger boy
Charley, appeared. He glanced towards the empty Editor’s
chair, then stammered.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, sir, I thought Mr. Hammond was here,
sir. They have jest blown up the tube to know if the
‘Prophet’s’ column was ready.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>Ralph Bastin noticed that the eyes of the boy flitted
from his face to the placard.</p>

<p>“Know what that means, Charley?” Bastin asked.</p>

<p>“Yus, sir, leastways, I knows what Mr. Hammond
means by it! E sez that Jesus Christ’s comin’ back, an’
goin’ to take all the real Christians out ’er the world,
an’ nobody wont see ’em go, nor nothink. I ’eard Mr.
Hammond ’splainin’ it all to a gent, t’other day.”</p>

<p>Curious to know if the boy himself had thought seriously
at all of the matter, Bastin said:—</p>

<p>“What do <i>you</i> think of it, Charley?”</p>

<p>“Wal, it’s like this, sir, I aint been to no Sunday
School since I wus quite a young ’un, ’bout eight perhaps.
An’ I never goes to no Church nor Chapel, cos why?
Why ’cos Sunday’s the only day—’cepts my ’olidays—when
I gits any chance fur any rickreation or fresh hair.
So I aint up much in ’ligious things. But my sister,
Lulu, she walks out wi’ a chap as teaches in a Sunday
School—leastways, he oosed to afore he took up wi’
our Lulu, but now ’e wants ’is Sunday School time fur
spoonying, an’ ’e can spoon, sir, there’s no error—well,
knowin’ as ’e oosed to do summat at ’ligion, I ups an’
arsks ’im about what Mr. Hammond said, about that
takin’ away business, an ’e (Jimmy Doubleyou, Lulu’s
chap, I mean, sir,) larfed, an’ said, “Don’t yer b’lieve any
sich rot! D’yer think Gawd ’ud go an’ <i>kidnap</i> all ’Is
people like that?”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> At a Bible-Reading in Malvern in the house of one of God’s
choicest saints, Miss Ann Boobbyer, where the precious truth of
“<i>The Rapture</i>” was being unfolded, a minister present, who was
much used of God, as an evangelist, started up, and cried,</p>
<p>“What! My Lord coming to <i>Kidnap</i> all His people? Never!
Never! I’ll not believe that!”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ralph Bastin would have smiled, at any other time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
at this curious reply. But, to-night, his soul was too
sobered. Gathering up the sheets of M.S.’s, he clipped
them together, stamped them with Hammond’s mechanical
imprimatur, and handed the sheaf to the lad, giving
him instructions to deliver them in the Composing Room.</p>

<p>As the lad left the room, he sat back in his chair,
and tried to think out the position of affairs. He had
hardly settled himself down, before the messenger boy
returned.</p>

<p>“’Scuse me, sir,” the lad began, “but summat curious
hev ’appened. There’s two ‘holy Joes,’ in the Composing
room, an’ one in the Sterio room—leastways, they
oosed to be—an’ they’s all three bunked off, somewheres,
nobody seed ’em go, an their coats an’ ’ats is ’ung hup
where they ussally is, an’ some o’ the chaps says as they’s
translated. Alf Charman, one o’ the comp’s, oosed to
talk like Mr. ’Ammond did, sir——”</p>

<p>The boy looked a trifle fearsomely at the empty editor’s
chair, as he added.</p>

<p>“Mr. ’Ammond, sir, I—er—I suppose as—’e—’e aint——.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hammond has gone out!” Bastin rapped out the
words quite sharply. All this talk of the missing men
was getting on his nerves.</p>

<p>“That will do, Charley!” he added.</p>

<p>The lad walked slowly to the door, his eyes fixed on
the placard, his lips moving to the words, “<i>To-day?”
“Perhaps!</i>”</p>

<p>“Coorius!” he muttered as he passed out of the room.</p>

<p>Ralph Bastin tried again to settle himself down for
a quiet think. Suddenly he started to his feet, wild
of eye, and with horror in his face.</p>

<p>“Viola?” he muttered. “My beautiful little Viola?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
She has talked continuously of the Christ of late. Has
she been——?”</p>

<p>He seized his hat, and with a crushed down sob of
literal fear, he rushed away.</p>

<p>Outside the office he came upon a hansom. He leaped
into it, shouting the Bloomsbury address to the man.</p>

<p>“Drive for your life!” he yelled. “A sovereign for
you if you get me there quickly!”</p>

<p>The man’s horse was fresh. They rushed through
the streets. Arriving at the house, he tossed the driver
his promised sovereign, and letting himself in with his
latch key, he dashed into the drawing room. It was
empty!</p>

<p>He was leaving the room hurriedly, when he encountered
the landlady. “Miss Viola has gone to bed, sir, she
overtired herself, visiting the sick-poor with her flowers,
and all that, to-day, and she——”</p>

<p>“Thanks!” with a hurried nod he raced up the stairs.
The child’s bedroom was next to his own. He entered it
without knocking. He was too much agitated to stand
upon ceremony.</p>

<p>The room was in darkness, he struck a match, laid
it to the gas nipple, then shot a quick glance at the bed.
In that first glance, he saw that it was empty. He went
close up to the bed, it had been occupied, he could see
that. He thrust his hand well down under the clothes.
There was faint body warmth left in the bedding—or it
seemed so to him.</p>

<p>“God help me?” he groaned. And two great tears
fell glittering from his eyes.</p>

<p>“Viola! Viola! my precious darling!” he moaned. “You
were my life, my——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>His emotion choked him. He was dropping into the
chair by the bedside, when he noticed that the back
and seat of the chair were strewn with the under-clothing,
which the child had evidently placed there when
disrobing.</p>

<p>With eyes blinded with tears, he lifted the dainty
garments in a pile, and laid them on the foot of the
bed. Then he dropped back into the chair, buried his
face in the pillow—the impress of the lost, beautiful
head was left in the pillow—and wept.</p>

<p>For five minutes he remained thus. Then rousing
himself, he muttered:—“I must play the man! and get
back to the office and lay hold of things.”</p>

<p>He left the room, and managed to clear the house
without encountering his landlady. Lucky in finding a
hansom, he had himself driven first to the central News
Agency. He wanted to find out if anything of the mystery
was generally known.</p>

<p>The careless-minded, light-hearted tapists, clerks and
journalists, were laughing over the few vague rumours
of the translation that had reached them.</p>

<p>He said nothing of what he knew, and drove on to
the office.</p>

<p>“If the world has to go on, for a time, just as it <i>has</i>
been going, in spite of this wonderful thing,” he muttered,
“then, as acting editor of the Courier, I had better
stifle every feeling, save the professional, and give London—England—the
best morning issue under the new
condition of things.”</p>

<p>Low, soft, yearning in its passionate longing for her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
Lord’s Return, she began again to hum her lay, when
a step sounded somewhere near. So keenly had her
imagination been aroused by her song, and by her long,
yearning-dwelling on the theme of the song, that she,
almost unconsciously to herself, rose to her feet, her
work and needle held lightly in her hand, her face turned
towards the door. For one instant, her imagination had
suggested the step to have been her Lord’s.</p>

<p>The next moment she turned deadly pale. She had
recognized the step. It was her husband’s.</p>

<p>She had just time to drop back into her chair, and,
tremblingly, to resume her work, when the brute entered.
He was drunk—viciously, murderously drunk.</p>

<p>He began to curse her, the moment he crossed the
threshold. He called her foul names that brought the
flush of a great shame—for <i>him</i>, not for herself—to her
cheeks. He sneered at her religion, and blasphemed the
name of her Lord.</p>

<p>Her lips moved, but no sound came from them. She
prayed for grace to be silent, for she feared to aggravate
him. Suddenly, he shook his fist in her face, and
hissed:—</p>

<p>“Curse you! You ——! Do you know I’ve only
come back to you to settle all my scores. I’ve come
to——”</p>

<p>His foaming, blaspheming rage choked him, and he
leaped forward, (she had drawn back from his clenched
fist) and caught her by the throat.</p>

<p>She could not cry out. She thought his purpose was
to strangle her. He glared murderously back into her
eyes, which his awful grip was forcing from their sockets.
He shook her fiercely, hurling hideous blasphemies at
her all the time. Then he essayed to put his real purpose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
in view, and drawing himself up, and drawing her, at
the same time, towards himself, he hurled himself forward
to dash her head against the wall of the room.</p>

<p>It was <i>his</i> head that struck the wall. His hands
clutched air. He fell head-long stunned, bleeding, and—presently,
he was dead.</p>

<p>The room was very still. Awesomely silent.</p>

<p>Margaret Joyce was <i>in the air</i>, with her Lord!</p>

<span class="smaller">A CASTAWAY.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Madge</span> and her husband left Albany on the Monday
morning, ostensibly for a brief honey-moon, but,
chiefly, with a view to recruit her husband’s health.
They had gone to a tiny little house among the Catskills,
kept by a coloured woman named “Julie.” The pastor
had been there before, and had himself chosen this quiet
retreat for their marriage trip.</p>

<p>The heart of Madge was broken, for her husband
would not be friendly with her. He was barely civil
when he spoke to her, and answered her in short, sharp
monosyllables only. All the old natural pride, with which
she would have met this treatment a fortnight ago, or
less, was, fortunately, for <i>him</i>, swallowed up in her new
found faith <i>in</i>, and her utter surrender <i>to</i> God. And
with this there had come to her the patience and purifying,
born of the Hope of the near return of the Lord,
whom she now loved.</p>

<p>She had been alone, thinking over the whole position,
for a couple of hours. The situation had become intolerable.
She determined to make an appeal to him, though
it hurt her natural pride even to contemplate it.</p>

<p>“Help me! Teach me! Guide me!” she cried unto
her God. And in the strength of the divine promises of
upholding and guidance, she decided to go to her husband.</p>

<p class="tb">He was alone, with a book before him on the table.
But he was not reading. He was not even thinking.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
His mind was in a confused whirl, born of the inward
rage of a much discomfited man. He had made a fool
of himself, in public. He knew it, and he had been too
proud to apologize. He had spurned and snubbed the
woman, for whom he had professed to be dying of love,
and who had made the greatest sacrifice any honest
woman can make to man—since she had offered herself
to him, in marriage.</p>

<p>He knew that, in the eyes of his wife, and in the eyes
of the little world he had lived and laboured in, that he
had lowered himself, had proved himself less than ordinarily
human.</p>

<p>Some of his own recent platform and pulpit utterances,
returned to his mind, and they stung him by their
reproach. The very last sermon he had preached, before
his breakdown of health, had had for its text, “To him
that overcometh, will I give——.”</p>

<p>In the course of his address he had alluded to the
shame of some of life’s failures, and had quoted William
S. Walsh’s “Ichabod.”</p>

<p>Now, as he sat brooding over his own fall, the lines
returned to him. They mocked him, gibed at him, becoming,
to his brooding imagination, sentient things with
laughing, mocking, sneering voices, that somehow contrived
to fling back into his ears, the very tones of his
own voice, as he had declaimed the verses from his
platform, weeks ago:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Alas, for the lofty dreaming,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The longed-for high emprise,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I looked on the life before me</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With purpose high and true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the passions of youth surged o’er me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the world was strange and true.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Where the hero-soul rejoices</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I would play the hero’s part;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My ears were attuned to the voices</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That speak to the poet’s heart.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I would conquer a place in story,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With a soul unsmirched by sin;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My heart should be crowned with glory,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My heart be pure within.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>But the hour that should have crowned me,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Cast all high hope adown,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>And the time of trial found me,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>A sinner, coward, clown.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The thought that many of those who heard him declaim
those lines, would be now recalling them, and perhaps
be applying them to himself, half maddened him. And
it was at this worst of all moments for her mission of
reconciliation, that Madge entered the room.</p>

<p>With a rare gentleness she began to plead with him,
reminding him of all the passionate love he had expressed
for her up to the very moment, almost, when they
entered the church together for that Sunday morning
service.</p>

<p>He answered her coldly, sullenly at first. Then he
grew pettishly angry with her, and snapped sharply at
her, contradicting her in nearly all she said:</p>

<p>“But, Homer,” she pleaded again, and in the deep
yearning heart to win him back to his old loving self,
she knelt before him, and tried to take his hand.</p>

<p>With an angry exclamation, he rose sharply to his
feet and thrust her away with his foot, as he cried:—</p>

<p>“I don’t want you! You go your way, I’ll go mine,
and——”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly. With a sharp cry of agony,
he stretched his hands out into the empty space, where
an instant before, she had knelt—for, in one flashing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
moment, she had disappeared from before his eyes.</p>

<p>“Madge! Madge, dear love, dear love, dear wife!”
he cried.</p>

<p>The sound of his own voice struck chilly upon his
soul. Deep, deep down in his heart he knew what had
happened—<i>only he would not own it to himself</i>.</p>

<p>He flashed a swift glance at the window and door.
Both were fast shut.</p>

<p>“This is what Doig preached! What Madge believed
would come to pass!” he cried, hoarsely.</p>

<p>There was a strange look of terror in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Julie will have gone, too, if it <i>is</i> the—the—.”</p>

<p>He did not finish his muttered thought. Like a man
walking in his sleep, he moved to the door, opened it,
and called, loudly:—“Julie!”</p>

<p>There came no reply. An eerie stillness was in the
house.</p>

<p>He moved on into the kitchen, the room was empty.
A saucepan of milk was boiling over on the hot-plate
of the grate!</p>

<p>He hurried into the garden, calling “Madge! Julie!”
There was no response.</p>

<p>He went back to the house. The turkeys had strayed
into the kitchen, there being no one to drive them back.
He made a hurried, fearsome tour of the house. Every
room was empty!</p>

<p>He went back to where he had been, when Madge
was taken, with a groan he dropped into his chair, staring
into space with horror-stricken eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as though a living voice uttered them, the
words of scripture sounded in his ears.</p>

<p>“<i>Lest, that by any means, when I have preached to
others, I myself should be a castaway!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>A mortal agony filled his eyes, as he groaned:—</p>

<p>“God help me! I know now that I have only been
a <i>minister</i>, by training and by profession, I have never
been a son of God by conversion, by the New Birth!”</p>

<p>His untaught soul had misinterpreted the real inwardness
of that passage of Paul’s. But it was true, in the
sense <i>he</i> meant it, he <i>was</i> “a castaway.”</p>

<span class="smaller">A STRICKEN CITY.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was not really until business time next morning,
that London, that the whole country, really fully
awoke to the fact of the great event of the previous
night. Suburbans, in many cases, only heard the strange
news on their arrival at their particular railway stations.
Even then, a hundred rumours were the order of the
moment. Everything reported was vague and shadowy.
There were a few rank unbelievers of the garbled stories
of the translation, who laughed sceptically, then began
to grumble at the strange disorganization of the Railway
traffic.</p>

<p>More than one annoyed, belated traveller, remarked
in similar terms to the utterance of a commercial traveller,
at Surbiton station:—</p>

<p>“If there is <i>any</i> actual truth in this story of the secret
translation of a number of religious people, then the
mysterious taking away of so many signal-men, and
engine-men, will be an eye-opener to the travelling public,
who never, somehow, suppose that Christianity is a strong
factor in the lives of railway men.”</p>

<p>“It is a revelation in another way,” remarked a second,
“since it suggests <i>why</i> we have hitherto had so few railway
accidents, <i>compared with other nations</i>.”</p>

<p>The tens and hundreds of thousands, the millions,
poured into London as usual. But the snap had gone
out of most of them. A horrible sense of foreboding,
was upon the spirits of the travellers. As the newspapers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
more fully confirmed the news, London
approached perilously near the verge of a general panic.</p>

<p>The newspapers were bought up with phenomenal eagerness.
“Souf Efriken War worn’t in it, fur clearin’
out peepers!” a street seller remarked.</p>

<p>But few of the morning papers, (except the “Courier”)
had anything special to say on the great event. Most
of them, in fact, were absolutely silent.</p>

<p>There were weather prophecies, political prophecies,
financial prophecies, social prophecies, sporting prophecies,
commercial prophecies,—but no prophecy of the
Coming of the Christ.</p>

<p>The “Courier’s” rival had a brief note to the effect:—</p>

<p>“Some wild, senseless rumours were abroad in London
last night, as to the sudden, mysterious disappearance of
numbers of the <i>ultra</i> religious persons of London, and
elsewhere. Some people talked wildly of the end of
the world. We therefore despatched special commissioners,
to ascertain what truth there was in all this.</p>

<p>Our representative returned an hour and a half later,
after having visited all the chief places of amusement
and principal restaurants. But everywhere managers told
the same story, ‘there has been no signs of the end of
the world in <i>our</i> place. We are fuller than ever.’</p>

<p>The genial manager of the —— Theatre, assured
our Representative, that no later than last Sunday morning,
he heard it repeated at his Church, that ‘as it was in
the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, <i>world without
end</i>, Amen.’ So that, for the life of him, he could not
conceive any one being such a fool as to talk of the end
of the world.”</p>

<p>But the note of the “Courier’s” clarion call had no
uncertain sound. Besides all that we have already seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
written in the office by the translated Tom Hammond,
and afterwards by Ralph Bastin, the latter had added
to his postscript, another. It was a solemn, a pathetic
word, and ran as follows:</p>

<p>“Our sheets must go to press in a few moments, if the
“Courier” is to be in the hands of its readers at the
usual hour. But before we print, we feel compelled to
add a word or two more to what we wrote two hours ago.</p>

<p>“During the last two hours, we have made many discoveries,
not the least of which, from the <i>personal</i> standpoint,
is the fact, that the nearest and dearest being to
our own heart and life, one whose life and thought, of
late, has been strangely taken up by the Christ of God,
is missing. She has shared in the glory and joy of the
wondrous, mysterious, and—to <i>most</i> of us, to <i>all</i> of us
surely who are <i>left</i>—<i>unexpected</i> translation.</p>

<p>“We have no wish or intention to parade our own
personal griefs before our readers, but dare to say that
no journalist ever worked with a more broken, crushed
sense of life, than did we during the two hours we afterwards
spent in searching London for facts.</p>

<p>“One curious fact which we speedily discovered, was,
that no one had been taken in this wondrous translation,
from any of the Theatres or music-halls. In the old
days—four <i>hours</i> ago, seems, to look back to, like four
centuries—before this awfully solemn event, discussions
arose, periodically, in certain religious and semi-religious
journals, as to whether <i>true</i> Christians could attend the
theatre and music-hall.”</p>

<p>“The fact that no one appears to have been translated
from any of these London houses of amusement, answers,
we think, that question, as it has never been answered
before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>Here followed a brief <i>resume</i> of his experiences in
other quarters. Then in big black type he asked the
question:—</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">What follows, (according to the Bible program)
this Stupendous Event?</span>—The Bible, evidently, (when
read aright) told those, who have been taken from our
midst, that this translation was approaching, then it
must surely give some hint of what we may expect to
follow so startling an episode as that of to-night. The
question is, <i>what</i> follows?”</p>

<p>“There must surely be many clergymen and ministers
who knew <i>about</i> this great translation, who though not
living in the spirit of what they knew, and being therefore
left behind, like the common ruck of those of us,
who were carelessly ignorant—there must be many such
ministers left, who could teach us <i>now, what</i> to expect
<i>next</i>, and <i>how</i> to prepare for the next eruption—whatever
form it may take.”</p>

<p>“We therefore propose to any such ministers, that
they gather us into the Albert Hall, Agricultural Hall,
St. Paul’s Cathedral, Spurgeon’s Tabernacle, Whitfields—why
not, in fact, into every church, chapel, Salvation
Army Barracks, or even in the great open spaces such
as Hyde Park, and other Parks, Primrose Hill, Hampstead
Heath, etc., and teach us, who are left behind
from the wondrous Translation, that has just occurred,
how to be prepared for the next mighty change, for we
believe the bulk of us are absolutely in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, are there no houses in Paternoster Row,
and its neighbourhood, where books and pamphlets on
these momentous subjects can be obtained, or are all
such publishers translated with those of whom we have
been writing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>One effect of the last suggestion, in Bastin’s <i>second</i>
postscript, was to send thousands of people to Paternoster
Row, the Square, Ivy Lane, and all the neighbourhood.
Some of the publishers of books on the Lord’s
Second Coming, <i>had</i> been <i>left</i> behind, had <i>not</i> shared
in the Rapture of which they had printed and published.</p>

<p>Storekeepers, packers, masters, clerks, were most of
them reading up the contents of their own wares. Business
system among them, at first, seemed an unknown
quantity. Deadness, amaze, fear, uncertainty, all of
these things held and dominated them.</p>

<p>But they had to wake up. Their counters were
besieged. Hordes of people thronged the doors. In
twenty minutes after the first great influx, there was
not a tract, a booklet, or a volume, on the “Lord’s coming,
and the events to follow,” left in the “Row.”</p>

<p>At any other time those in command of the stores,
would have tried to get the printing presses at work, to
run off some hundreds of thousands of the briefest of
the “Second Advent” literature. But, to-day, fear, nameless
fear held every one in thrall.</p>

<p>The “Row” put up shutters, and went home—or at
least got away from business.</p>

<p>Business, everywhere, was at a standstill. By eleven
o’clock most of the city houses were closed. Some of
the banks never opened at all. Throgmorton Street and
the Stock Exchange were in a state of dazed incredulity.
A few members were missing, and these were known
to be “Expectants” of the Translation.</p>

<p>“Salvation S——, is gone!” some one called out.</p>

<p>“Aye!” cried another, “I’d give all I possess, or ever
hoped to possess, to be where he is now. I remember
how he tried and prayed to persuade me once to——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>There was a rush of members across “The Floor” at
that moment. Some one had a proposition to make,
namely a trip to 101 Queen Victoria Street, to see if
there were any Salvationists left there. A little band,
about a dozen, responded, and the silk-hatted, excited
little crowd swept away on their curious quest.</p>

<span class="smaller">“HALLELUJAH LASS.”</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">There</span> was one “Hallelujah Lass,” in the front shop,
at the “Headquarters.” She was bonnetless, but
the big, navy-blue head-dress laid on a glass show-case.
She wore a finely-knitted crimson jersey and braided
blue skirt. Her eyes were red with weeping. She was
strangely distraught. There was no lilt of the song upon
her lips:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh! the peace my Saviour gives,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Peace I never knew before.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Not all translated then?” began the leader of the
Stock Exchange band, addressing her.</p>

<p>There was nothing flippant, nothing sneering in his
tone or manner.</p>

<p>The girl essayed a reply, but at first it ended in a sob
only. Presently she recovered herself enough to say:—</p>

<p>“No, we’re not <i>all</i> translated! You see, sir, the Army,
as a body, never quite admitted the truth of <i>this</i> Second
coming of our Lord. It has always preached that we,
as an Army of Salvation, were raised up by God to get
<i>all the world</i> converted. A lady in the train, as I came
up to business, only yesterday——”</p>

<p>The girl sighed wearily, as she interpolated, “Yesterday
seems as far off as Wesley’s times. But, only yesterday,
this lady, in the train talked to me about the
‘Lord’s near return’—that is how <i>she</i> put it—and said,
‘God is undoubtedly using the Army in evangelizing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
distant heathen, and thus allowing them to fulfil His purpose
in calling out those who are to form the Bride of
the Heavenly Bridegroom—but, believe me, my dear, the
world will never be converted <i>before</i> Christ comes for
His Church.’</p>

<p>“She talked to me very beautifully, and simply, only,
as she said, one could only grasp these truths in proportion
as one kept clear in their minds the things which
belonged to the separate dispensations.</p>

<p>“‘If,’ she said, ‘The Lord came to-night’—how little
she or I dreamed that He actually would—‘this dispensation
would be closed, and a new one would begin
to-morrow.’”</p>

<p>The girl looked around in a bewildered way, almost
as though she was looking for something she had lost.</p>

<p>“I have never known anything about the dispensations,
and their bearing on the Bible,” she went on. “The
Army has always taught us that we should <i>all</i> die, lie in
our graves until “the <i>last Day</i>,” then appear before the
Great White Throne, and be judged according to our
lives, and all that. The lady who spoke to me yesterday—yesterday?
oh, how far off it seems—explained to me,
<i>from the Bible</i>, that true Christians would <i>never</i> appear
before the Great White Throne.</p>

<p>“That when the Great White Throne shall be set, the
real Christian will be seated in glory <i>with</i> Jesus, the
Judge. And only the wicked, unsaved dead will be judged
there. The sin of the <i>true</i> Christian, she said, is done
with, settled, put away at the Cross.</p>

<p>“‘There is therefore <i>now no</i> condemnation (<i>judgment</i>)
to them who are <i>in</i> Christ Jesus.’ ‘He that heareth, and
believeth on Jesus, <i>hath</i> everlasting life, and <i>shall not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
come into the judgment</i>, but <i>is</i> passed from death unto
life.’</p>

<p>“She told me that the true Christian, who might be
living, when the Lord should Return, would be caught up
<i>into the air</i>, with all the Christian dead, who will rise
from their graves; and, that then the only judgment that
can ever come to the Christian, will take place. That will
be at Christ’s judgment <i>of Rewards</i>. She said that
eternal life did not enter into the question. That was settled
once and for ever, but at Christ’s Reward-judgment,
the Christian’s <i>work</i> would be tried.”</p>

<p>Some of the silk-hatted listening men began to fidget.
All this talk was foreign and uninteresting to them.</p>

<p>“The lady,” the girl went on, “promised to meet me
this morning at the station, at the same time as we met
yesterday, ‘<i>Should the Lord Tarry</i>’ she said. But I saw
nothing of her this morning. She had been ‘<i>caught up</i>,’
of course, to meet her Lord in the air, and I——”</p>

<p>The girl’s voice broke, her eyes streamed with tears.
One of the youngest of the stock-brokers asked:—</p>

<p>“But why, if Salvationists are Christians, are <i>you</i> here?
Why were <i>you</i> not translated?”</p>

<p>“God help me!” she cried, “I know <i>now</i>, now that it
is too late, that I was never converted. I was drawn
into an Army meeting by reports I heard of the singing
and music. The Army’s methods fascinated me—the
young officer who came to our town, was a very taking
fellow. He talked to me in an after-meeting, I wept
with the many emotions that were at work within me;
I went to the penitent form—and—and—afterwards
joined the Salvation Army—but I know <i>now</i>, I was not
really saved.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>She caught her breath in a quick sob, then a little glow
suddenly filled her face, as she added:—</p>

<p>“But I have settled the matter this morning. I have
yielded, intelligently to Christ, and I know that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent2">I and King Jesus are one.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“And,” she cried, her eyes flashing with a holy light,
“If witnessing for Jesus means martyrdom, then, by
God’s grace, I’ll show by my death that——”</p>

<p>“Are there many Salvationists left?” interrupted one
of her listeners.</p>

<p>A quick flush dyed her cheek; as she replied:—</p>

<p>“I <i>can’t</i> say! There are some here at head-quarters,
whom I should not have thought would have been <i>left
behind</i>, but who are. Though I don’t believe there will
be more, if so many Salvationists, as other sects, <i>in
proportion</i>, be found to be left behind, or——”</p>

<p>The sound of thousands of tramping feet broke into
the girl’s speech. The little crowd of Stock-brokers
rushed to the door.</p>

<p>A dense mass of men and women were marching up
the street. Every face was set and serious. There were
many clergymen and ministers in the crowd, if the
clerical collar and ministerial garb gave true indication
of their calling.</p>

<p>“To St. Paul’s! To St. Paul’s!” a stentorian voice
was shouting.</p>

<p>The stock-brokers joined the mighty crowd, which,
grim, resolute, silent, swept on.</p>

<p class="tb">By midnight, or soon after, a few hours only after
the great Translation, the hordes of the vicious that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
festered in the slums—women, as well as men, <i>aliens</i> and
British alike—had heard something of what had happened,
and creeping from their filthy lairs, began, at
once to become a menace to public life and property.</p>

<p>Many of the police beats were unprotected, the men
who had been patrolling them sharing in the sudden
glorious Rapture of their Lord’s return. By midnight,
the whole police service had become temporarily disorganized,
if not actually demoralized.</p>

<p>Scotland Yard heads of departments were missing, as
well as local Superintendents, Sergeants, etc. In many
cases there was no one to give orders, or to maintain
control. And where leaders <i>were</i> left, they were often
too scared and unnerved to exercise a healthful authority.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances the hordes of vicious, and
out of work grew bolder every hour. They had no fear
of the Spiritual character of the strange situation, for
God, to them, was a name only to blaspheme. Hell was
a merry jest to them, a synonym for warmth and rest,—a
combination which had been all too rare with them on
earth. Besides, Hell had no shadow of terror to people
who, for years, had suffered the torments of a life in a
literal hell in London.</p>

<p>Shops, and private houses, and some of the larger
business houses had been openly burgled. A rumour got
abroad, that the Banks were to be raided.</p>

<p>Ralph Bastin, passing the Bank of England, found
that the guard of Soldiers had been quadrupled, and this
too for the <i>day</i>-time. Curious to know how the Translation
of the night before had affected the army, he asked
one of the privates if any of the London soldiers were
missing?</p>

<p>“All the ‘blue-lights,’ (as we calls the Christians, sir,)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
is missin’. Yer see, sir, if a feller perfesses to be a
Chrishun in the Army, an’ aint real, ’e soon gits the
perfession knocked outer ’im. On the other han’ if
’e’s real, why all the persekushun on’y drives ’is ’ligion
deeper inter ’im. Yes, all the ‘blue-lights’ is gone, sir, an’
any amount o’ officers.</p>

<p>“These, as is gone, is mos’ly the middle-age an’ ole
ones, an’ those wot’s been in India, Malta, an’ other
furrin stations. I’ve knowed lots o’ that sort o’ officer, as
oosed to hev Bible-Readin’s at their Bungalows. Ah, they
wur <i>right</i>, they wur, the other wur wrong, an’ the wrong
’uns knows to-day as they’s out o’ luck!</p>

<p>“If yer arsks my erpinun, ser, I sez, that London’s
full o’ fools, to-day, fur if we’d all been doin’ an’ thinkin’
as we’d oughter, why we’d be now up in Glory wi Jesus.
I’ve yeard the truth at So’dger Homes, an’ sich places,
an’ I’ve sung wi’ lots o’ others:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching;</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The man suddenly straightened himself, and glanced
away from Bastin. An officer was approaching.</p>

<p>Ralph Bastin walked away, the thought that filled his
mind, was of the strange mood that had suddenly come
over <i>every</i>one, since to-day, everybody seemed ready to
talk freely of religious things.</p>

<p>He moved on up Cheapside, his destination being St.
Paul’s Cathedral.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">IN ST. PAUL’S.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">The</span> cathedral was packed, packed out to the doors.
The aisles, and every other inch of standing-room
was a solid Jam. The whole area of the interior showed
one black mass of silent waiting, expectant people—it
was curious to note that almost every woman had donned
black, in some form or other.</p>

<p>The great organ was silent. No one dreamed of
singing. The choir seats were full of strangers. The
stalls were filled with an indiscriminate crowd. There
was no rule, no discipline to-day.</p>

<p>Suddenly the tall, square-built form of a certain well-known
Bishop, rose near the pulpit. He had linked his
arm in that of one of London’s most popular Nonconformist
preachers, and almost dragged him to his
feet.</p>

<p>There was evidently a controversy going on between
the two men as to which of them should address the
people, each urging the other to lead off. The same
thought was in the minds of nearly all who were in view
of the pair, <i>namely</i>, “how comes it that a Bishop, and a
popular preacher like the Rev. ——, have been left
behind?”</p>

<p>A strange new tenseness, a deepening silence, settled
upon the mighty mass gathered under that great dome.
Suddenly the silence was broken by a voice calling:</p>

<p>“Bishop ——.” Another voice immediately cried,
“No! The Rev. ——.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>A momentary clamour of voices ensued. The voices
were not shrill in their eagerness, but sullen, sombre,
almost savage, in fact. A moment, and the Bishop slowly
entered the pulpit. He bowed his head in prayer.</p>

<p>Like the slow, rushing sound of the letting loose of
some distant water, the noise of thousands of bending
forms filled the place, for everyone bowed the head.</p>

<p>A moment later, the heads were raised. The silence
almost of a tomb filled the place, when the first momentary
rustle of the uprearing had subsided.</p>

<p>The voice of the Bishop broke the silence, crying:—</p>

<p>“Men and women of London, fellows with me in the
greatest shame the world has ever known—the shame of
bearing the name Christian, and yet of being the rejected
of Christ,—we meet to-day under awful, solemn circumstances.</p>

<p>“We are face to face with the most solemnly awful
situation the human race has ever known, if we except
the conditions under which, during those three hours
of blackness at Calvary, the people of Jerusalem were
found, while the Crucified Christ hung mid-air, on the
Fatal Tree.</p>

<p>“It may be said that our position bears some likeness
to that of the people who were destroyed at the Flood.
Those antediluvians had one hundred and twenty years
warning, we, as professing Christians, have had nearly
two thousand years warning, yet, London, England and
the whole world has by last night’s events, been proved
practically heathen—or atheist, atheist will perhaps best
fit our character.</p>

<p>“The moment came when God called Noah and his
family into the ark. But what never occurred to me,
until this morning, was the significant fact, that God did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
not shut the door of the ark, or send the flood, until
<i>seven days later</i>, thus giving the unbelievers another
opportunity to be saved.</p>

<p>“And God has given London, England, America, the
world, this same extra opportunity of being prepared
for the Return of the Lord, and the Translation of His
Church.</p>

<p>“For, for some years, now, conferences, and conventions,
addresses, Bible-Readings, etc., where this subject
of the Second Coming of Christ has been specially taught,
has been multiplied mightily. I have been present at some
of these gatherings, but, smiling amusedly at what I
termed the wild utterances of visionaries, I neglected my
opportunity.</p>

<p>“Yet, of all men, <i>I</i> ought to have been prepared for
this Coming of the Lord. I have held ministerial office
in a church that taught the doctrine, plainly, in many of
its prayers and collects. But I see, now, that all through
my life, I have been blinded by the <i>letter</i> of things, and
have mistaken christening, confirmation, communicating,
for conversion, and for life in Christ.</p>

<p>“I see, to-day, that I entered the established church of
this realm, and not the family of God, and the service of
Christ. I have never really been God’s, by the New
Birth, until last night, when my dear wife, in company
with all the waiting, longing church, was suddenly called
up to be with her Lord. Not by death, dear friends—she
saw no death—but by that sudden translation, that has
startled us all so.”</p>

<p>A low sobbing sound ran through all the building. The
gathered thousands, almost to a man, realised that they,
with the speaker, were equally lifeless, spiritually.</p>

<p>“I was in the room when my wife disappeared,” the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
Bishop went on. “She had been very ill. It became
necessary to perform a critical operation on her. I
insisted on being present. I see the scene now.</p>

<p>“The nurses standing by the antiseptic baths with the
sponges and clips immersed. In the eerie silence of that
room, no sound came save the voice of the great surgeon,
as he cried ‘clip’—‘iodoform’—‘bandages.’ Suddenly, as
he half turned to take a bandage of the nurse, the form
of my precious wife disappeared from the operating table.
One of the nurses at the antiseptic bowl, was gone also.</p>

<p>“And I, a <i>professed</i> servant of the Christ who had
called the translated ones, was <i>left</i>, with the great surgeon,
and others, as you, dear friends, many, <i>most</i> perhaps,
members of some Christian church, have been left.</p>

<p>“‘Sister Carrie gone too!’ cried the great surgeon,
‘then you may depend, Bishop, that Christ has come for
all His real church, for Nurse Carrie lived in daily, hourly
expectation of some kind of translation.’ With a
puzzled look upon his face, he said, suddenly:</p>

<p>“‘But, Bishop, how is it that you are left behind, who,
of all men in our midst, one would have thought would
have gone?’</p>

<p>“I had to say last night to him, dear friends, what,
with shame and regret, I have to say to you now, that
I <i>ought</i> to have known the Truth, and have been prepared,
but because I was unconverted, I had failed to
apprehend the fact of the Lord’s near Return.</p>

<p>“Yet, how often, on the third Sunday in Advent, have
I, with many of you, repeated the <i>Great Truth</i>, in the
collect:—</p>

<p>“‘O Lord Jesus Christ, who, at Thy first coming,
didst send Thy messenger to prepare Thy way before
Thee; Grant that the ministers and stewards of Thy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
mysteries, may likewise so prepare and make ready Thy
way, by turning the hearts of the disobedient to the
wisdom of the just, that at Thy <i>second</i> coming to judge
the world, we may be found an acceptable people in Thy
sight, who livest and reignest with the Father, and the
Holy Spirit, ever one God, world without end. Amen.’</p>

<p>“In the burial of our dead, too, how often have I
recited, and have heard the words,</p>

<p>“‘Beseeching Thee that it may please Thee, of Thy
gracious goodness, <i>shortly to accomplish the number of
Thine elect</i>, and to hasten Thy Kingdom; that we, <i>with</i>
all those that are departed in the True faith of Thy Holy
Name, may have our perfect consummation and bliss, both
in body and soul, in Thy eternal and everlasting glory;
through Jesus Christ our Lord.’</p>

<p>“Again, the words of Paul in the matter of the Lord’s
Supper ‘<span class="smcap">Till He Come!</span>’ ought to have opened my eyes.
But I confess, with shame, I have been blind, a blind
leader of the blind——”</p>

<p>Visible emotion checked the Bishop’s speech, for a
moment. Recovering himself, he went on:—</p>

<p>“A blind leader of the blind, because unborn of God.
I <i>ought</i> to have known that Christ’s Return was near. I
<i>should</i> have known it, had I been spiritually-minded, by
the signs of the Apostasy which, (prophesied to precede
the Second Coming of the Lord) have been having their
fulfillment all around us for years.</p>

<p>“Since last night, I have lived a whole life-time. I
have read the whole of the Gospels and Epistles, and,
taking my true place as a lost soul before God, I have
been born of God. And now, here, in this solemn moment,
I bring to you the Spirit-taught knowledge that has been
given to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p>For a few minutes, he traversed ground already covered
in these pages, then, continuing, he said:—</p>

<p>“Last Sunday, when, in all the pride of my office, I
preached—preached in my unconscious unbelief—I
quoted those lines of the poet:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘They pass me like shadows, crowds on crowds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dim ghosts of men, that hover to and fro,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hugging their bodies round them like their shrouds</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Wherein their souls were buried long ago;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They trampled on their youth, and faith and love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With Heaven’s clear messages they madly strove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And conquered—and their spirits turned to clay....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas! poor fools, the anointed eye may trace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A dead soul’s epitaph in every face.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“To-day, friends, I know that ‘the anointed eye’ must
have traced ‘The dead soul’s epitaph,’ in my <i>life</i>, if not
in my face.</p>

<p>“Now let us face our present position, as those who
are <i>left</i>! What is the future to be? This is what you
need to know, what I need to know! <i>First</i>, let me say,
the next thing for each to do is to seek the Lord, to cry
unto Him for mercy and pardon, while all our hearts
are shocked and startled, and our thoughts are turned
God-wards. For unless we close with God, become His,
and live out the future to Him, our portion will be an
Eternal Hell.”</p>

<p>An awful hush rested upon the gathered thousands, as
he proceeded:—</p>

<p>“One thing appears very plain from Scripture, that is,
that when, last night, Christ came into the air and caught
up His Church, living and dead, that the Devil, who has
been the Prince of the Power of <i>the air</i>, had to descend to
earth. Christ and Beelzebub can never live together in
the same realm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>“In the re-creation of this earth, recorded in Genesis,
God blessed everything that He created, <i>save the atmosphere</i>,
He <i>did</i> not, He <i>could</i> not bless that because Satan,
driven from the re-created earth, by the breath of the
divine Spirit, had taken refuge <i>in the air</i>. He is therefore
called in Scripture, not only the ‘<i>Prince of this
World</i>,’ but ‘<span class="smcap">The Prince of the power of the air</span>.’</p>

<p>“Now, beloved, the Spirit of God has left the earth.
The Devil has taken up his abode here with all his myriad
agents, and he is going to make earth as hot for those of
us who will witness for God, as is hell itself to the lost.</p>

<p>“If we will witness for God during the years we are
beginning to-day—called the years of ‘The Great Tribulation,’
they will probably be seven in number, and extend
therefore to the dawning moment of the Millennium—if
we witness therefore for God, I say, during these intervening
seven years, we may expect to meet with hideous
trial and suffering.</p>

<p>“Antichrist will now soon make himself known—he
will be a <i>man</i>, not a system, mind,—he will mislead the
Jews, who will now, immediately, return to their own
land, and build their New Temple. For a time, Antichrist
will appear to be the friends of the Jews, but he
will seek to force the most awful idolatry upon them.
The mass of Jewry will accept all this.</p>

<p>“With the Jew, every Gentile will presently be compelled
to accept Antichrist, and the Roman Beast——”</p>

<p>A sound of protest was heard from a seat near the
pulpit, as the Bishop spoke of the “Roman Beast.” But
the preacher took no note of the interruption and went
on:—</p>

<p>“The Devil will be so mad at being cast down out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
heaven, and because he knows such a very limited time
to work against God, that he will call up all hell to stamp
out God’s people.”</p>

<p>For one instant the Bishop paused. He leaned over
the pulpit edge, his eyes were full of the light of a holy
determination, but into his voice there crept a tender
yearning, as he continued:—</p>

<p>“Are we prepared for actual martyrdom? For this will
certainly be the fate of many who will not bear about
upon them the mark of the Beast.”</p>

<p>Again there came a growl from that seat near the
pulpit. But the most solemn hush rested upon the vast
mass of people.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">Quietly</span>, giving the impression that the sense of
a great shame rested upon him, the Rev. —— ——
the noted popular Nonconformist minister rose from his
seat and faced the congregation.</p>

<p>Many of his own church were there. Many others,
who had followed the criticisms of the more spiritual-toned
Christian papers, upon his pulpit and other utterances,
were there. Every one waited breathless, wondering
what contribution he would make to the great matter
in hand.</p>

<p>It was evident that it was only by the exercise of tremendous
will-power that he could restrain his emotions
sufficiently to speak.</p>

<p>“God help me, dear friends!” he began, “for I know
now that I have been a Judas to the Lord of Life and
Glory, whose <i>professed</i> servant I have been. I have
gloried in my success; in the crowd that always filled my
church; in the adulation of my intellectual powers by
the Press. But I have never glorified Christ. In a hundred
subtle ways I have denied my Lord——He <i>is</i> my
Lord <i>now</i>, I have found Him in the silence of the past
awful night——. I have been practically denying His
deity for years, I have talked learnedly, when I ought to
have been walking humbly, and—and——.”</p>

<p>The strain was too much for him, tears streamed down
his face, he covered his face with his hands, and dropped,
sobbing, into his seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>Sobs broke from many of the people. Weeping is
infectious. In another moment the released pent-up emotions
would have become a storm that none could have
stayed. But the Bishop’s voice called out,</p>

<p>“Let us pray!”</p>

<p>Every head was bent, and a prayer, such as London’s
Cathedral had never heard before, poured from the
Bishop’s lips. The conclusion of the prayer was followed
by a moment or two of deepest stillness.</p>

<p>The silence was, suddenly, sharply broken by a full,
rich voice crying:—</p>

<p>“Sit up, dear friends! Hear ye the word of the Lord!”</p>

<p>As the people lifted their heads a cry of amaze rang
out from many throats:—</p>

<p>“The Monk of ——!”</p>

<p>The face of the Monk was familiar to all Londoners
by his photograph, which beside being on sale in the shops,
had appeared again and again in magazines. He had a
striking figure, and there was a curious picturesqueness
about his appearance, with his smooth, clean-shaven face,
eagle eyes, tonsured crown, and curious purple-brown
cowled habit, girdled with a stout yellow cord about the
waist. His bare feet were sandaled. His hands, long,
thin, with white tapering fingers, were outstretched a
moment, then dropped slowly as he went on:—</p>

<p>“These are times when no one of us may shrink from
speaking the truth boldly, if the Truth has been committed
to us.</p>

<p>“With all due respect to our friend, Bishop ——, I
would say, that all the surmises abroad in London, to-day,
and those that have been voiced in our hearing here,
during this hour, are wrong!</p>

<p>“The true meaning of the mysterious disappearance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
so many ultra-protestants, is this: The great end <i>is</i> near!
God’s work was being frustrated by those unholy zealots,
who have been therefore graciously snatched away to hell,
before they could do further mischief.”</p>

<p>Murmurs of dissent and protest ran through the mass
of people, like the low sullen roar, at sea, of a coming
storm.</p>

<p>The Bishop thought of his Translated wife. He knew,
too, that God not only indwelt himself, now, but that
He had guided him in speaking to the people. He rose
in the pulpit to protest against the words of the Romanist.</p>

<p>But a voice cried out from the congregation:—</p>

<p>“Let the Monk have his say. These are strange times,
and we would hear all sides before we can judge.”</p>

<p>And the Monk went on:—</p>

<p>“His supreme Holiness, the Pontiff, had been warned
of God—as he is God’s Regent on earth—of the event
that has happened in our midst. His priests were warned
a few days ago, and in most of our churches, last Sunday,
certain dark hints of the coming catastrophe were given.
God therefore, now, calls upon you all, through me, to
turn to the <i>true</i> church, the <i>real</i> church, the church of
St. Peter’s, the church of Rome——.”</p>

<p>A storm of protesting murmurs rolled up from the
people.</p>

<p>He waited, smiling confidently a moment. Then he
went on:</p>

<p>“When all the inhabitants of the earth bear upon them
the sign of the true church——”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Mark of the Beast!</span>” yelled a voice.</p>

<p>Another instant and there would have been a hideous
uproar, but that everything became forgotten in a new
excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>From outside, in the street, there rose the roar of a
multitude, crying “Fire!” Fortunately the packed congregation
within the Cathedral, one and all realised that
the alarming thing was <i>out</i>side, not <i>in</i>side the building,
so that there was no panic.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the great place was cleared. The
Bishop, the Great Nonconformist, and a dozen other
ministers, and laymen, remained gathered together as by
a common instinct, by the pulpit.</p>

<p>“What is coming, brethren?”</p>

<p>“The <i>power</i> of Antichrist, and the manifestation of The
man of Sin, himself,” cried the Bishop, solemnly. “The
Monk of ——,” he went on “has been the first to voice
the awful claims of this Man of Sin.”</p>

<p class="tb">A week later!!!</p>

<p>Like a sow that returneth to the mire, London, England,
the world had returned to its old careless life. The
fever for sport, pleasure, money-getting, drinking, gambling,
licentiousness, was fiercer than ever. Everyone
aimed at forgetting what had happened a week before—and
the bulk of the people were succeeding in finding the
lethal element.</p>

<p>There had been many conversions during the first forty-eight
hours <i>after</i> the Translation of the Church, but,
since then, scarcely one. Already there had arisen, all
over the land, all over the world in fact, as the American,
Australasian, and Foreign Press Telegrams made clear,
a multitude of men and women who were preaching the
maddest, most dangerous doctrines.</p>

<p>Among the most popular, and successful, of these was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
Spiritualism. Not the comparatively mild form known
<i>before</i> the Great Translation, but an open, hideous blasphemous
exhibition that proved itself to be, what it had
really always been—<i>demonology</i>.</p>

<p>Antichrist’s sway had begun. Satan was a <i>positive,
active</i>, agent. The restraints of the Holy Spirit were
missing, for <i>HE</i> had left the earth when the Church had
been taken away. Other restraints were also taken from
the midst of the people, since, whether the world recognise
it or not, the fact remains, that the people of God are
the Salt, the preservative of the earth.</p>

<p class="tb">Final word! Whether or no, the writer has failed in
the purpose he had when he set pen to paper; whether
or no he has bungled his subject; whether the reader is,
or is not willing to accept the main statements of the
special teaching in this book, does not really affect the
real question, namely, <i>The Near Return of our Lord.</i> His
word to us, whether we believe and accept it, or whether
we slight and reject it, is:—</p>

<p>“BEHOLD I COME QUICKLY!” <span class="smcap">Be YE also
ready, for in such an hour as ye think not, the
Son of Man COMETH.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">For the Lord Himself SHALL descend from
Heaven.... And the dead in Christ shall
rise FIRST: Then, we which are alive and remain,
shall be Caught up together with them IN THE
CLOUDS, to meet the Lord IN THE AIR: and so
shall we ever be with the Lord!</span></p>

<p class="hanging">TO-DAY?<br />
PERHAPS!</p>

<p class="tb">The continuation of this Book is published under the title “The
Mark of the Beast.”</p>
